OpenSPP Service Points
======================

This document outlines the **OpenSPP Service Points** module, which adds
functionality to manage service points and their agents within the
OpenSPP ecosystem. It enables the registration and tracking of service
points, their associated areas, offered services, and their connection
to company entities and their respective contacts.

Purpose
-------

The **OpenSPP Service Points** module is designed to:

-  **Manage Service Point Information**: Store and manage details about
   each service point, including their name, location, contact
   information, and operational status.
-  **Associate Service Points with Areas**: Link service points to
   specific geographical areas defined in the `spp_area <spp_area>`__
   module, enabling location-based management and reporting.
-  **Define and Assign Service Types**: Categorize service points based
   on the types of services they provide, facilitating targeted program
   delivery and monitoring.
-  **Connect with Company Entities**: Establish a relationship between
   service points and formal company entities within the system.
-  **Manage User Accounts for Contacts**: Facilitate the creation and
   management of user accounts for individuals associated with the
   company linked to a service point.

Dependencies and Integration
----------------------------

1. **G2P Registry: Base
   (**\ `g2p_registry_base <g2p_registry_base>`__\ **)**: Leverages the
   core registrant management features provided by the **G2P Registry:
   Base** module. This includes the use of the ``res.partner`` model to
   represent both companies and individuals associated with service
   points.

2. **OpenSPP Area (**\ `spp_area <spp_area>`__\ **)**: Integrates with
   the **OpenSPP Area** module to associate service points with specific
   geographic areas. The ``area_id`` field on the ``spp.service.point``
   model links a service point to an area defined in the **OpenSPP
   Area** module.

3. **Phone Validation (phone_validation)**: Utilizes the **Phone
   Validation** module to ensure phone numbers associated with service
   points are properly formatted and validated.

4. **Auth Signup (auth_signup)**: Integrates with the **Auth Signup**
   module to streamline the creation of user accounts for contacts
   associated with companies linked to service points.

Additional Functionality
------------------------

-  **Service Point Management (spp.service.point)**:

   -  Introduces a dedicated model (``spp.service.point``) for storing
      and managing service point data.
   -  Tracks service point operational status (active/disabled) and
      maintains a history of status changes.
   -  Provides functionality to disable and enable service points,
      recording reasons for disabling.

-  **Service Type Definition (spp.service.type)**:

   -  Includes a model (``spp.service.type``) for defining and managing
      different categories of services offered by service points.

-  **User Account Creation**:

   -  Offers a streamlined process to automatically create user accounts
      for contacts associated with the company linked to a service
      point.
   -  Assigns appropriate security groups to newly created users to
      manage access permissions.

Conclusion
----------

The **OpenSPP Service Points** module streamlines the management of
service points and their agents within the OpenSPP system. It provides a
structured approach to track service point details, connect them to
geographical locations and company entities, and manage user accounts
for individuals involved in service delivery. This contributes to a more
organized and efficient operation of social protection programs and
farmer registries.
