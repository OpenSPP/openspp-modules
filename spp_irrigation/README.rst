OpenSPP Irrigation
==================

Overview
--------

The OpenSPP Irrigation module enhances the OpenSPP platform by providing
tools for managing and visualizing irrigation infrastructure. It builds
upon the GIS capabilities provided by the [OpenSPP Base GIS
Module](OpenSPP Base GIS Module)(./spp_base_gis.md) to represent
irrigation assets spatially.

This module is particularly valuable for programs and projects that
involve:

-  **Irrigation Management:** Tracking and monitoring irrigation
   infrastructure like reservoirs, canals, and potentially even
   individual irrigation systems.
-  **Water Resource Planning:** Visualizing water sources and their
   distribution networks to aid in resource allocation and planning.
-  **Impact Assessment:** Analyzing the geographic reach of irrigation
   systems and their impact on agricultural productivity.

Functionality
-------------

The Irrigation module introduces the following key features:

-  **Irrigation Asset Model:** A new model (``spp.irrigation.asset``) is
   introduced to store information about various types of irrigation
   infrastructure. This model includes fields for:

   -  **Name/ID:** A unique identifier for the asset.
   -  **Category:** Classifies the asset (e.g., reservoir). More
      categories can be added as needed.
   -  **Total Capacity:** Relevant for storage assets like reservoirs.
   -  **Coordinates (GeoPoint):** Stores the precise location of the
      asset on the map.
   -  **Geo Polygon (GeoPolygon):** Allows defining the area covered by
      the asset, particularly useful for reservoirs or irrigated zones.
   -  **Irrigation Sources/Destinations (Many2Many):** Establishes
      relationships between irrigation assets to represent how water
      flows within the network.

-  **GIS Integration:** Leveraging the [OpenSPP Base GIS Module](OpenSPP
   Base GIS Module)(./spp_base_gis.md), the Irrigation module enables:

   -  **Visualization:** Irrigation assets can be displayed on the map
      as points (using coordinates) or polygons (using the GeoPolygon
      field).
   -  **Data Layers:** Users can create dedicated data layers to
      represent different types of irrigation assets with specific
      colors, icons, or other styling options.
   -  **Spatial Analysis:** The module allows users to perform spatial
      queries to find assets within a specific region, identify assets
      near other points of interest (e.g., farms), and analyze the
      proximity of irrigation infrastructure to agricultural lands.

Integration with Other Modules
------------------------------

The OpenSPP Irrigation module is designed to work seamlessly with other
modules in the OpenSPP ecosystem:

-  **[OpenSPP Base GIS Module](OpenSPP Base GIS
   Module)(./spp_base_gis.md):** Provides the foundation for GIS
   visualization and spatial data management.
-  **Farmer Registry:** The irrigation assets can be linked to specific
   farmers or agricultural plots in a farmer registry to understand
   which farmers have access to irrigation.
-  **Program Targeting and Monitoring:** Information about irrigation
   access can be factored into program eligibility criteria, and the
   effectiveness of irrigation interventions can be monitored spatially.

Example Use Case
----------------

Consider an agricultural development program that aims to improve water
access for farmers. The Irrigation module can be used to:

1. **Map Existing Infrastructure:** Record the locations and details of
   existing reservoirs, canals, and other irrigation assets in the
   program area.
2. **Plan New Interventions:** Visualize the locations of water sources
   and plan the development of new irrigation infrastructure to reach
   underserved areas.
3. **Target Beneficiaries:** Identify farmers located within the service
   area of specific irrigation systems for program participation.
4. **Monitor Impact:** Track changes in agricultural productivity in
   areas with improved irrigation access over time.

Conclusion
----------

The OpenSPP Irrigation Module is a valuable tool for managing irrigation
data, analyzing its spatial distribution, and integrating this
information with other OpenSPP modules for improved program planning,
targeting, and impact assessment.
