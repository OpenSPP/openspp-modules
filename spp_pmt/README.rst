OpenSPP Proxy Means Testing
===========================

This document describes the **OpenSPP Proxy Means Testing (spp_pmt)**
module, which extends the OpenSPP framework to incorporate Proxy Means
Testing (PMT) functionalities. This module allows program implementers
to calculate a PMT score for groups of registrants based on specific
criteria, aiding in the identification and prioritization of
beneficiaries for social protection programs.

Purpose
-------

The **spp_pmt** module aims to:

-  **Enable Proxy Means Testing**: Provide the tools to calculate a PMT
   score for groups of registrants, using weighted criteria relevant to
   the specific program context.
-  **Customize PMT Criteria**: Allow administrators to define and
   configure the criteria used in the PMT calculation, tailoring the
   assessment to their program's needs.
-  **Integrate with Existing Registry Data**: Leverage existing data
   from the OpenSPP registry modules to perform the PMT calculation,
   minimizing data duplication and ensuring consistency.

Dependencies and Integration
----------------------------

1. `g2p_registry_base <g2p_registry_base>`__ : The **spp_pmt** module
   depends on the **G2P Registry: Base** module for access to core
   registrant data, including group memberships. It utilizes this data
   to determine the individuals associated with each group and to
   retrieve their relevant attributes for the PMT calculation.

2. `g2p_registry_group <g2p_registry_group>`__ : This module leverages
   the group representation and group kind functionality provided by the
   **G2P Registry: Group** module. It integrates with group forms to
   display the calculated PMT score.

3. `spp_custom_fields_ui <spp_custom_fields_ui>`__ : The **spp_pmt**
   module relies on the **OpenSPP: Custom Fields UI** module to enable
   the configuration of PMT-specific criteria. This integration allows
   administrators to define which custom fields are relevant to the PMT
   calculation and assign weights to these fields based on their
   relative importance.

4. `spp_area <spp_area>`__ : This module integrates with the **OpenSPP
   Area** module to factor in geographical variations in the PMT
   calculation. This allows for more nuanced and context-specific
   assessments, recognizing that certain criteria may have varying
   weights depending on the location.

Additional Functionality
------------------------

-  **PMT Calculation Logic**: Introduces the core logic for calculating
   the PMT score. This logic takes into account the following:

   -  **Group Memberships**: Identifies all individuals belonging to a
      particular group.
   -  **Custom Field Weights**: Retrieves the weights assigned to
      relevant custom fields, as defined in the
      `spp_custom_fields_ui <spp_custom_fields_ui>`__ module.
   -  **Area-Specific Weights**: Factors in any geographical variations
      in the weights assigned to custom fields, using data from the
      `spp_area <spp_area>`__ module.
   -  **Score Aggregation**: Calculates a weighted average of the
      relevant criteria for each individual within a group, then
      aggregates these individual scores to determine the overall PMT
      score for the group.

-  **PMT Score Display**: Extends the group view in the
   `g2p_registry_group <g2p_registry_group>`__ module to display the
   calculated PMT score for each group. This allows users to quickly
   assess the relative need of different groups based on the defined PMT
   criteria.

-  **Customizable Criteria**:

   -  Leverages the flexibility of the
      `spp_custom_fields_ui <spp_custom_fields_ui>`__ module to enable
      administrators to define and configure the criteria used in the
      PMT calculation.
   -  Allows for the inclusion of both individual-level and group-level
      custom fields in the calculation, providing a comprehensive
      assessment.

Conclusion
----------

The **OpenSPP Proxy Means Testing (spp_pmt)** module adds a valuable
tool for targeting and prioritizing beneficiaries in social protection
programs. By integrating seamlessly with other OpenSPP modules, it
leverages existing registry data and customizable configuration options
to provide a flexible and context-specific PMT calculation.
