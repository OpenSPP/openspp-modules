OpenSPP Farmer Registry Base
============================

Overview
--------

The ``spp_farmer_registry_base`` module serves as the foundation for
managing farmer registries within the OpenSPP system. It builds upon
several core OpenSPP modules to provide functionalities specific to
farmer registration and farm data management.

Purpose
-------

This module aims to:

-  Extend the generic registry features to capture data relevant to
   farmers and their agricultural practices.
-  Model the relationships between farmers, farms, land parcels, and
   agricultural activities.
-  Integrate with GIS capabilities to visualize farm locations and land
   boundaries.

Module Dependencies and Integration
-----------------------------------

1. `g2p_registry_membership <g2p_registry_membership>`__: Used to manage
   memberships between individual registrants and groups.
2. `spp_base_gis <spp_base_gis>`__: Provides the foundation for
   visualizing and interacting with geospatial data.
3. `spp_land_record <spp_land_record>`__: Enables managing and
   visualizing land records, linking them to farms and registrants.
4. `g2p_registry_base <g2p_registry_base>`__: Provides the basic
   structure for managing registrant data, relationships, and
   identification.
5. `g2p_registry_group <g2p_registry_group>`__: Extends the base
   registry to handle groups of registrants, such as farmer
   cooperatives.
6. `g2p_registry_individual <g2p_registry_individual>`__: Extends the
   base registry with functionalities for managing individual registrant
   data.

Functionality and Integration Details
-------------------------------------

Farmer Information
------------------

-  Extends the ``res.partner`` model (from
   `g2p_registry_base <g2p_registry_base>`__) to include farmer-specific
   details like years of experience, formal agricultural training,
   household size, etc.
-  Introduces a temporary model ``spp.farmer`` to store farmer-specific
   information that can be later transferred to the main ``res.partner``
   model, ensuring data consistency.
-  Integrates with `g2p_registry_individual <g2p_registry_individual>`__
   to leverage existing features for managing individual registrant
   profiles.

Farm Management
---------------

-  Introduces the ``Farm`` model (inheriting from ``res.partner``) to
   represent individual farms.
-  Links farms to land records using the ``spp.land.record`` model,
   enabling the tracking of land parcels associated with each farm.
-  Allows recording details about farm types, sizes, legal status, and
   other relevant information.

Agricultural Activities
-----------------------

-  Introduces the ``spp.farm.activity`` model to record information
   about agricultural activities undertaken on each farm.
-  Captures data on crop cultivation, livestock rearing, and aquaculture
   practices.
-  Links activities to specific land parcels using the
   ``spp.land.record`` model, providing a granular view of land use
   within a farm.

Farm Assets and Inputs
----------------------

-  Introduces models for managing farm assets (``spp.farm.asset``) and
   inputs like fertilizers (``spp.fertilizer``), chemicals
   (``spp.farm.chemical``), and feed items (``spp.feed.items``).
-  Allows associating these assets and inputs with specific farms and,
   optionally, to specific land parcels within a farm.

GIS Integration
---------------

-  Leverages the `spp_base_gis <spp_base_gis>`__ module to enable
   visualization of farm locations and land boundaries on a map.
-  Provides a dedicated GIS view for ``res.partner`` to display farms
   and their associated land parcels.
-  Utilizes GeoJSON representations of land records from
   `spp_land_record <spp_land_record>`__ to display farm boundaries as
   data layers on the map.

Additional Features
-------------------

-  **Extension Services:** Records details about extension services
   provided to farmers, linked to specific farms and optionally to
   specific land parcels.
-  **Species Information:** Includes a dedicated model
   (``spp.farm.species``) for managing information about crop,
   livestock, and aquaculture species relevant to the registry.

Conclusion
----------

The ``spp_farmer_registry_base`` module, through its integration with
various other OpenSPP modules, provides a comprehensive system for
creating and managing detailed farmer registries. It not only
facilitates the collection of essential farmer and farm data but also
enables spatial analysis and visualization, making it a powerful tool
for agricultural development programs and initiatives.
