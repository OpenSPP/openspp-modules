OpenSPP Custom Field Recompute Daily
====================================

This module extends the functionality of OpenSPP by introducing a
mechanism to recompute specific fields on a daily basis. This is
particularly useful for maintaining up-to-date values for fields that
are computationally intensive or rely on frequently changing data.

Purpose
-------

The primary goal of this module is to:

-  **Enable daily recomputation of fields:** Allow administrators to
   mark specific fields for daily recomputation.
-  **Improve performance:** By offloading computationally expensive
   field calculations to a scheduled task, the module prevents
   performance bottlenecks during regular system operations.
-  **Ensure data accuracy:** Regular recomputation ensures that fields
   relying on dynamic data remain consistent and reflect the latest
   information.

Functionality and Integration
-----------------------------

Integration with ``queue_job``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This module leverages the ``queue_job`` module to handle the
asynchronous recomputation of fields. When a field marked for "Daily
Recompute" needs updating, the module creates a background job using
``queue_job``. This approach prevents the recomputation process from
impacting the system's responsiveness, especially when dealing with
large datasets.

Integration with ``base_setup``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The module integrates with ``base_setup`` to provide configuration
options for daily recomputation. Administrators can set the "Maximum
Daily Recompute Records Count" through the "Settings" menu. This
parameter limits the number of records processed synchronously during
each recomputation cycle, preventing potential performance issues.

Key Features
------------

-  **Field level configuration:** The module adds a "Daily Recompute"
   checkbox to the field definition in the Odoo interface. Enabling this
   option marks the field for daily recomputation.
-  **Cron Job:** A scheduled task runs daily to trigger the
   recomputation of marked fields.
-  **Performance optimization:** The recomputation process is designed
   to be asynchronous and utilizes the ``queue_job`` framework to
   minimize the impact on system performance.
-  **Configuration options:** Administrators can define the maximum
   number of records to be recomputed synchronously, allowing for
   fine-tuning based on system capacity.

Usage
-----

1. **Enable "Daily Recompute":** In the Odoo interface, navigate to the
   technical settings of the desired model. Locate the field you want to
   recompute daily and enable the "Daily Recompute" option.
2. **Configure Recomputation Settings (Optional):** Access the
   "Settings" menu and locate the "Daily Recomputing" section. Adjust
   the "Maximum Daily Recompute Records Count" based on your system's
   capacity and performance requirements.

Once configured, the module automatically handles the daily
recomputation of the marked fields in the background. This ensures that
your data remains consistent and up-to-date without impacting the
performance of other system operations.

.. IMPORTANT::
   This is an alpha version, the data model and design can change at any time without warning.
   Only for development or testing purpose, do not use in production.
