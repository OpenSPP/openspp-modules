OpenSPP Base
============

This document outlines the functionality of the **OpenSPP Base** module,
the core module for the OpenSPP system. It builds upon existing G2P
Registry modules, providing essential customizations and configurations
for OpenSPP's specialized functionalities.

Purpose
-------

The **OpenSPP Base** module serves as the foundation for other OpenSPP
modules, offering:

-  **Centralized configurations**: Provides essential settings and
   options that apply across the entire OpenSPP system.
-  **UI modifications**: Customizes the user interface (UI) to align
   with OpenSPP's look and feel, enhancing user experience.
-  **Extension points**: Acts as a base for other modules to inherit and
   extend functionalities specific to OpenSPP requirements.

Module Dependencies and Integration
-----------------------------------

The **OpenSPP Base** module depends on several other modules,
integrating their features and extending them for OpenSPP:

-  `spp_idqueue <spp_idqueue>`__ : Leverages this module for managing ID
   card printing requests and workflows.
-  `spp_service_points <spp_service_points>`__: Utilizes this module to
   manage service points and their association with areas, companies,
   and users.
-  `spp_custom_fields_ui <spp_custom_fields_ui>`__: Depends on this
   module for a user-friendly interface to manage custom fields for
   registrants.
-  `g2p_registry_membership <g2p_registry_membership>`__: Integrates
   with this module to manage memberships between individual registrants
   and groups.
-  `spp_custom_field <spp_custom_field>`__: Extends this module's
   functionality to add and manage custom fields for registrants,
   enhancing data collection capabilities.
-  `spp_programs <spp_programs>`__: Integrates with this module for
   managing both cash and in-kind programs and entitlements.
-  `spp_area <spp_area>`__: Utilizes this module to manage geographical
   areas and link them to registrants and other relevant data.
-  `g2p_registry_base <g2p_registry_base>`__: Inherits core registry
   functionalities from this module, including registrant management,
   IDs, relationships, and districts.
-  `g2p_registry_group <g2p_registry_group>`__: Integrates with this
   module to manage groups of registrants, extending the concept of
   registrants beyond individuals.
-  `utm <utm>`__: Leverages this module for tracking and managing UTM
   (Urchin Tracking Module) parameters, commonly used in digital
   marketing campaigns.
-  `g2p_registry_individual <g2p_registry_individual>`__: Integrates
   with this module to manage individual registrant data, including
   specific attributes and validations.

Additional Functionality
------------------------

The **OpenSPP Base** module introduces the following key
functionalities:

-  **Top-up Card ID Type**: Adds a new ID type specifically for managing
   "Top-up Cards", including a dedicated field (``card_uid``) for
   storing the unique 10-character UID of each card.
-  **Registrant View Enhancements**: Modifies the registrant views (both
   individual and group) to include the ``card_uid`` field, making it
   accessible for data entry and display.
-  **Menu Icon Customization**: Replaces the default icon for the
   "Registry" menu item with a custom OpenSPP icon, enhancing visual
   branding.
-  **Menu Item Hiding**: Hides specific menu items related to "Link
   Tracker" and "Discuss" to streamline the OpenSPP user interface and
   focus on relevant functionalities.

Conclusion
----------

The **OpenSPP Base** module acts as the backbone of the OpenSPP system,
integrating and extending the functionalities of its dependencies to
create a cohesive and tailored platform. Its role in providing central
configurations, UI modifications, and extension points makes it
essential for the proper functioning and customization of OpenSPP's
specialized features.
