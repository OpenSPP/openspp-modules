OpenSPP Consent Module
======================

Overview
--------

The OpenSPP Consent module enhances the functionality of the
`g2p_registry_individual <g2p_registry_individual>`__ and
`g2p_registry_group <g2p_registry_group>`__ modules by providing a
framework for managing and tracking consents provided by registrants
(both individuals and groups). This module is essential for ensuring
compliance with data privacy regulations and maintaining ethical data
management practices within social protection programs.

Features
--------

-  **Consent Recording:** Allows authorized users to record consents
   obtained from registrants, specifying the type of consent, the
   signatory (for groups), and the expiry date.
-  **Consent Management:** Provides a centralized repository for storing
   and managing all recorded consents, making it easy to track consent
   status and expiry dates.
-  **Consent Integration:** Seamlessly integrates with the registrant
   profiles in the `g2p_registry_individual <g2p_registry_individual>`__
   and `g2p_registry_group <g2p_registry_group>`__ modules, providing
   direct access to consent information from the registrant's record.
-  **Expired Consent Tracking:** Includes a dedicated view for
   monitoring expired consents, enabling proactive management of consent
   renewals and ensuring continued compliance.

Functionality and Integration
-----------------------------

The OpenSPP Consent module introduces the following key elements:

-  **Consent Configuration:** Defines different types of consents that
   can be recorded within the system.
-  **Consent Model:** Stores information related to each consent,
   including the type of consent, associated registrant (individual or
   group), signatory, expiry date, and related configuration.
-  **Consent Mixin:** A mixin model that extends the functionality of
   the ``res.partner`` model (used for both individuals and groups) in
   the registry modules. This mixin adds a relationship field to link
   registrants with their respective consents.
-  **Consent Wizard:** Provides a user-friendly interface for recording
   new consents, accessible directly from the registrant's profile.
-  **Expired Consent View:** Offers a dedicated view for easily
   identifying and managing consents that have passed their expiry date.

Benefits
--------

-  **Enhanced Data Privacy:** Ensures compliance with data privacy
   regulations by explicitly obtaining and tracking consents for data
   processing activities.
-  **Improved Transparency:** Increases transparency by providing a
   clear record of consents obtained from registrants.
-  **Streamlined Consent Management:** Simplifies the process of
   managing consents, reducing administrative burden and the risk of
   errors.
-  **Proactive Compliance:** Enables proactive management of consents,
   ensuring timely renewals and minimizing the risk of non-compliance.

By integrating the OpenSPP Consent module with your existing registry
system, you can significantly strengthen your data protection measures
and promote ethical data management practices within your social
protection programs.
