OpenSPP Service Point Device
============================

This document outlines the **OpenSPP Service Point Device** module,
which extends the functionality of the
`spp_service_points <spp_service_points>`__ module to manage terminal
devices associated with each service point. It allows for the
registration and tracking of devices used at service points, including
their model, Android version, and active status.

Purpose
-------

The **OpenSPP Service Point Device** module aims to:

-  **Track Terminal Devices:** Maintain a record of all terminal devices
   used at each service point within the OpenSPP system.
-  **Manage Device Information:** Store relevant details about each
   device, such as the model, Android version, and a unique external
   identifier.
-  **Monitor Device Status:** Track the active status of devices to
   identify and manage any inactive or unavailable devices.
-  **Integrate with Service Points:** Seamlessly connect device
   information to its corresponding service point for centralized
   management and reporting.

Dependencies and Integration
----------------------------

1. `spp_service_points <spp_service_points>`__: This module directly
   builds upon the **OpenSPP Service Points** module. It utilizes the
   ``spp.service.point`` model to link devices to their respective
   service points using the ``service_point_id`` field.

Additional Functionality
------------------------

-  **Device Management (spp.service.point.device):**

   -  Introduces a new model (``spp.service.point.device``) specifically
      for managing terminal device information.
   -  Provides fields to capture device-specific details like model,
      Android version, external identifier, and active status.
   -  Enables users to activate or deactivate devices and provides a
      visual indicator of their status.

-  **Service Point Integration:**

   -  Extends the ``spp.service.point`` model with a new button to
      access and manage the associated terminal devices.
   -  Offers a dedicated view to list and manage all devices linked to a
      specific service point.

Conclusion
----------

The **OpenSPP Service Point Device** module enhances the OpenSPP system
by providing a structured way to manage and monitor terminal devices
deployed at various service points. By centralizing device information
and linking it to service points, this module contributes to better
hardware resource management and supports the efficient operation of
social protection programs and farmer registries.
