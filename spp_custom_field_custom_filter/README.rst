OpenSPP Custom Field Custom Filter
==================================

Overview
--------

The **SPP Custom Field - Custom Filter Integration** module bridges the
functionality of the [G2P Registry: Custom Fields UI](G2P Registry:
Custom Fields UI) module and the [SPP Custom Filter](SPP Custom Filter)
module. It allows administrators to decide whether a custom field,
created through the [G2P Registry: Custom Fields UI](G2P Registry:
Custom Fields UI](G2P Registry: Custom Fields UI](G2P Registry: Custom
Fields UI) module and the [SPP Custom Filter](SPP Custom Filter) module.
It allows administrators to decide whether a custom field, created
through the [G2P Registry: Custom Fields UI) module, should be available
for filtering within the system. This integration provides a
comprehensive approach to managing both the definition and usability of
custom fields within the OpenSPP platform.

Purpose
-------

The primary goal of this module is to enhance the filtering capabilities
of custom fields within OpenSPP. By enabling the "Allow Filter" option
for specific custom fields, administrators can empower users to filter
and analyze registry data based on these custom attributes. This
granular control over filterable fields contributes to a more efficient
and tailored user experience.

Integration and Functionality
-----------------------------

1. **Dependency on Custom Field Definition:** This module relies on the
   [G2P Registry: Custom Fields UI](G2P Registry: Custom Fields UI)
   module for the creation and management of custom fields. It extends
   the functionality of this module by adding a filtering dimension to
   the custom field definition.

2. **Integration with Custom Filter Logic:** It seamlessly integrates
   with the [SPP Custom Filter](SPP Custom Filter) module, which
   provides the underlying mechanism for controlling the visibility of
   fields in filter dropdowns. The "Allow Filter" option, added by this
   module, acts as a flag that the [SPP Custom Filter](SPP Custom
   Filter](SPP Custom Filter](SPP Custom Filter) module, which provides
   the underlying mechanism for controlling the visibility of fields in
   filter dropdowns. The "Allow Filter" option, added by this module,
   acts as a flag that the [SPP Custom Filter) module uses to determine
   whether to display a custom field in the filter interface.

3. **User Interface Enhancement:** From the user perspective, enabling
   the "Allow Filter" option for a custom field results in that field
   appearing as a selectable option in the filter dropdown menus,
   alongside standard fields. This allows users to construct specific
   queries and filter data based on the values stored in these custom
   fields.

Example Use Case
----------------

Let's say a program using OpenSPP has defined a custom field called
"Disability Status" to track the disability status of registrants. By
enabling the "Allow Filter" option for this custom field, program staff
can easily filter the registry to identify and target interventions for
registrants with specific disabilities. This streamlines program
operations and allows for more effective service delivery.

Conclusion
----------

The **SPP Custom Field - Custom Filter Integration** module plays a
crucial role in maximizing the utility of custom fields within OpenSPP.
By linking custom field definitions with filtering capabilities, this
module provides a powerful tool for data analysis, reporting, and
program implementation. It contributes to a more flexible and
user-friendly system that can be readily adapted to the specific needs
of diverse social protection programs.
