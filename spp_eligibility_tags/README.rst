OpenSPP Tag Based Eligibility Manager
=====================================

This document outlines the functionality of the **OpenSPP Tag Based
Eligibility Manager** module within the OpenSPP ecosystem. This module
extends the eligibility management capabilities of OpenSPP, providing a
flexible and efficient way to define eligibility criteria based on
registrant tags and geographical areas.

Purpose
-------

The **OpenSPP Tag Based Eligibility Manager** module allows program
administrators to:

-  **Define eligibility rules using registrant tags:** Instead of
   manually selecting individual beneficiaries or relying solely on
   demographic data, programs can leverage the existing tagging system
   within OpenSPP to target specific groups of registrants based on
   shared characteristics, program participation history, or other
   relevant factors.
-  **Incorporate geographical targeting:** Administrators can further
   refine eligibility criteria by specifying geographical areas. This
   enables programs to target beneficiaries residing within specific
   districts or regions, enhancing the precision of program targeting
   and resource allocation.
-  **Simplify and automate eligibility verification:** By defining
   eligibility rules based on tags and areas, the module automates the
   process of identifying eligible beneficiaries. This reduces manual
   effort, minimizes errors, and ensures consistent application of
   eligibility criteria.

Module Dependencies and Integration
-----------------------------------

1. **G2P Registry: Base
   (**\ `g2p_registry_base <g2p_registry_base>`__\ **\ (./g2p_registry_base.md))**:

   -  Utilizes the tagging functionality of the base registry module to
      define eligibility rules based on registrant tags.
   -  Leverages the geographical information associated with
      registrants, specifically their assigned areas, to apply
      area-based eligibility criteria.

2. **G2P Programs
   (**\ `g2p_programs <g2p_programs>`__\ **\ (./g2p_programs.md))**:

   -  Extends the core program management module by introducing a new
      type of eligibility manager, the **Tag Based Eligibility
      Manager**.
   -  Integrates seamlessly with existing program workflows, allowing
      administrators to select and configure the **Tag Based Eligibility
      Manager** for specific programs.

3. **OpenSPP Programs
   (**\ `spp_programs <spp_programs>`__\ **\ (./spp_programs.md))**:

   -  Leverages the functionality of the OpenSPP Programs module,
      particularly its handling of program memberships and beneficiary
      enrollment.
   -  Ensures compatibility with both cash and in-kind entitlement
      programs, allowing for tag-based eligibility determination across
      different program types.

Additional Functionality
------------------------

-  **Tag Based Eligibility Manager Model
   (g2p.program_membership.manager.tags):**

   -  This model extends the base **Eligibility Manager** model within
      G2P Programs, introducing fields for selecting tags and areas to
      define eligibility criteria.
   -  Provides a user-friendly interface for administrators to configure
      tag-based eligibility rules, with clear visualization of the
      selected criteria.

-  **Automated Eligibility Verification:**

   -  When a program cycle is initiated, the **Tag Based Eligibility
      Manager** automatically identifies and flags registrants who meet
      the defined tag and area-based criteria as eligible.
   -  This automated process streamlines beneficiary enrollment, saving
      time and ensuring accuracy in identifying qualified individuals or
      groups.

-  **Dynamic Eligibility Updates:**

   -  As registrants' tags or area assignments change (e.g., due to data
      updates, program participation, or relocation), the module
      dynamically reassesses their eligibility status.
   -  This ensures that eligibility remains current and reflects the
      most up-to-date information, minimizing instances of ineligible
      beneficiaries receiving benefits or eligible beneficiaries being
      excluded.

-  **Improved Program Targeting and Efficiency:**

   -  By leveraging tags and areas, programs can target specific
      segments of the population more effectively, ensuring that
      benefits reach the intended recipients.
   -  This targeted approach enhances program impact and optimizes
      resource allocation by focusing on beneficiaries who are most
      likely to benefit from the program's interventions.

Conclusion
----------

The **OpenSPP Tag Based Eligibility Manager** module empowers program
implementers to define sophisticated eligibility criteria using a
flexible and efficient tag-based approach. By seamlessly integrating
with existing OpenSPP modules and automating key processes, it
simplifies program administration, enhances targeting accuracy, and
contributes to the overall effectiveness of social protection and
agricultural support programs.
