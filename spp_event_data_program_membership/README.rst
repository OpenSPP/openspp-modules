OpenSPP Event Data Program Membership
=====================================

This module enhances the functionality of OpenSPP by integrating the
**Event Data** module (`spp_event_data <spp_event_data>`__) with the
**G2P Programs** module
([g2p_programs](spp_event_data](g2p_programs](spp_event_data)) with the
**G2P Programs** module ([g2p_programs)). It allows users to record and
track program membership-related events within the OpenSPP system.

Purpose
-------

The **spp_event_data_program_membership** module serves to:

-  **Record Program Membership Events:** Log specific events related to
   program membership, such as enrollment, suspension, exit, and changes
   in eligibility status.
-  **Link Events to Program Memberships:** Associate these events with
   the corresponding program membership records in the
   `g2p_programs <g2p_programs>`__ module.
-  **Provide an Event History:** Offer a comprehensive history of events
   associated with each program membership, facilitating tracking and
   auditing.

Module Integration
------------------

1. `spp_event_data <spp_event_data>`__\ **:** This module leverages the
   event data framework provided by the
   [spp_event_data](spp_event_data](spp_event_data](spp_event_data):\*\*
   This module leverages the event data framework provided by the
   [spp_event_data) module to record and manage event information.
2. `g2p_programs <g2p_programs>`__\ **:** It integrates directly with
   the [g2p_programs](g2p_programs](g2p_programs](g2p_programs):\*\* It
   integrates directly with the [g2p_programs) module, linking event
   data to the relevant program membership records
   (``g2p.program_membership`` model).

Additional Functionality
------------------------

-  **Program Membership Field in Event Data:**

   -  Adds a ``program_membership_id`` field to the ``spp.event.data``
      model, allowing users to directly associate an event with a
      specific program membership.
   -  Includes a computed domain (``program_membership_id_domain``) to
      dynamically filter and display only relevant program memberships
      based on the selected partner.

-  **Modified Event Data Views:**

   -  Updates the event data form view
      (``view_spp_event_data_form_custom``) to include the new
      ``program_membership_id`` field.
   -  Enables users to select the relevant program membership when
      creating or editing an event.

-  **Read-Only Event Data Fields on Registrant Form:**

   -  Modifies the registrant form view
      (``view_groups_event_data_form_custom``) to display event data in
      read-only mode.
   -  Prevents accidental modification of event data from the
      registrant's profile.

Usage Example
-------------

1. **Recording an Enrollment Event:** A program officer enrolls a
   beneficiary into a social assistance program. Using this module, they
   can create a new event of type "Enrollment," link it to the
   beneficiary's newly created program membership record, and record
   relevant details, such as the enrollment date.

2. **Tracking Eligibility Changes:** A beneficiary's eligibility status
   changes due to a change in their circumstances. A program officer can
   record this event, selecting "Eligibility Change" as the event type
   and associating it with the beneficiary's program membership.

3. **Viewing Event History:** Program staff can access a beneficiary's
   program membership record and view a chronological list of all
   events, providing a clear audit trail of their participation in the
   program.

Conclusion
----------

The **spp_event_data_program_membership** module enhances the tracking
and management of program membership events within OpenSPP. By
integrating event data with program memberships, it improves data
integrity, transparency, and the overall efficiency of program
administration.
