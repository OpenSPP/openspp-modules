OpenSPP Registrant Import
=========================

This document describes the **OpenSPP Registrant Import** module, which
enhances the import functionality within the OpenSPP system,
specifically focusing on streamlining the process of importing
registrant data. It builds upon the existing import capabilities and
introduces features to improve data mapping and ID management.

Purpose
-------

The **OpenSPP Registrant Import** module aims to:

-  **Simplify Data Mapping**: Provide a more intuitive way to map
   imported data fields to corresponding fields in OpenSPP's registrant
   models. This reduces the complexity of data preparation and ensures
   accurate data import.
-  **Enhance ID Management**: Introduce a mechanism to generate and
   assign unique OpenSPP IDs (spp_id) to registrants during the import
   process. This ensures data integrity and facilitates efficient
   tracking and management of registrants within the system.

Dependencies and Integration
----------------------------

1. **OpenSPP Base** (`spp_base <spp_base>`__): Inherits core
   functionalities from the **OpenSPP Base** module, including access to
   registrant models and configurations.

2. **OpenSPP Service Points**
   (`spp_service_points <spp_service_points>`__): Leverages the
   **OpenSPP Service Points** module to associate imported service point
   data with existing service points in the system using unique IDs.

3. **OpenSPP Area** (`spp_area <spp_area>`__): Integrates with the
   **OpenSPP Area** module to link imported registrant data to specific
   geographical areas based on unique IDs.

4. **G2P Registry: Group**
   (`g2p_registry_group <g2p_registry_group>`__): Works in conjunction
   with the **G2P Registry: Group** module to facilitate the import of
   group registrant data and manage group IDs.

5. **G2P Registry: Individual**
   (`g2p_registry_individual <g2p_registry_individual>`__): Integrates
   with the **G2P Registry: Individual** module to import individual
   registrant data and assign individual-specific IDs.

Additional Functionality
------------------------

-  **Unique ID Generation and Assignment**:

   -  Automatically generates unique OpenSPP IDs (spp_id) for
      registrants during import if an ID is not provided in the import
      file.
   -  Adheres to a predefined format for spp_id based on the registrant
      type (individual, group, service point, area) ensuring
      consistency.

-  **Improved Data Mapping**:

   -  Enhances the existing import mapping interface to allow users to
      directly map columns from their import file to the corresponding
      fields in OpenSPP's registrant models.
   -  Provides visual cues and validation during the mapping process to
      minimize errors and ensure accurate data association.

Conclusion
----------

The **OpenSPP Registrant Import** module streamlines the process of
importing registrant data into the OpenSPP system. By simplifying data
mapping and automating unique ID generation and assignment, this module
enhances data integrity, reduces manual effort, and improves the overall
efficiency of data management within OpenSPP.
