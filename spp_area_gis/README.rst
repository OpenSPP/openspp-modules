OpenSPP Area GIS
================

The **OpenSPP Area GIS** module extends the functionality of the
`OpenSPP Area <link-to-area-module-documentation>`__ module by
integrating Geographical Information System (GIS) capabilities. This
module allows users to visualize and interact with geographical areas on
a map, providing a spatial dimension to area management within OpenSPP.

Purpose
-------

The main purpose of the **OpenSPP Area GIS** module is to:

-  **Visualize Areas on a Map:** Display areas defined in the `OpenSPP
   Area <spp_area>`__ module on an interactive map, providing a visual
   representation of their geographical extents.
-  **Associate Coordinates with Areas:** Enable users to assign
   geographical coordinates (latitude and longitude) to individual
   areas, either manually or through data imports.
-  **Define Area Polygons:** Allow for the creation and editing of
   polygon geometries that accurately represent the boundaries of areas.
-  **Integrate with OpenSPP Base GIS:** Leverage the functionality
   provided by the `OpenSPP Base GIS <spp_base_gis>`__ module to display
   areas as data layers on maps, enabling users to overlay them with
   other relevant data.

Dependencies and Integration
----------------------------

-  **OpenSPP Area (**\ `spp_area <spp_area>`__\ **):** This module
   directly depends on the OpenSPP Area module, inheriting its core
   functionality for managing area hierarchies and information.
-  **OpenSPP Base GIS (**\ `spp_base_gis <spp_base_gis>`__\ **):** The
   module integrates with the OpenSPP Base GIS module to utilize its GIS
   capabilities, such as map views, raster layers, and data layer
   management.

Functionality and Features
--------------------------

-  **Area Coordinates (spp.area):**

   -  Adds two fields to the ``spp.area`` model:

      -  **Coordinates (coordinates):** Stores the latitude and
         longitude coordinates of a point representing the area's
         location. This can be a central point or any other relevant
         location within the area.
      -  **Area Polygon (geo_polygon):** Stores a polygon geometry
         representing the area's boundary.

-  **Area Import with Coordinates:**

   -  Extends the area import functionality to include support for
      importing latitude and longitude coordinates along with other area
      data.
   -  Allows users to specify the columns containing latitude and
      longitude information during the import process.

-  **GIS Views for Areas:**

   -  Introduces GIS views for the ``spp.area`` model, enabling users to
      visualize areas on a map.
   -  Utilizes the `OpenSPP Base GIS <spp_base_gis>`__ module to
      configure data layers that represent areas as points (based on
      coordinates) and polygons (based on area polygons).
   -  Allows users to customize the appearance of area data layers on
      the map, such as colors, opacity, and labels.

-  **Integration with Other Data Layers:**

   -  Enables users to overlay area data layers with other relevant data
      layers, such as beneficiary locations, program intervention zones,
      or environmental data.
   -  Facilitates spatial analysis by allowing users to visualize and
      analyze the relationships between areas and other geospatial data.

Benefits
--------

-  **Improved Visualization:** Provides a clear and intuitive way to
   visualize area hierarchies and boundaries on a map, enhancing
   understanding of geographical coverage.
-  **Enhanced Targeting and Analysis:** Enables location-based targeting
   by visualizing the spatial distribution of areas in relation to
   beneficiary locations or other relevant factors.
-  **Improved Data Management:** Allows for more precise and efficient
   management of area data by integrating geographical coordinates and
   polygons.
-  **Enhanced Monitoring and Evaluation:** Facilitates spatial analysis
   for monitoring and evaluation purposes, allowing users to assess
   program coverage, identify gaps and overlaps, and track progress over
   time.

Example Use Cases
-----------------

-  **Visualizing Administrative Boundaries:** Displaying a hierarchy of
   administrative areas, such as provinces, districts, and villages, on
   a map to understand their geographical distribution.
-  **Targeting Interventions:** Overlapping area boundaries with
   beneficiary locations to identify areas with high concentrations of
   target populations for program interventions.
-  **Monitoring Program Coverage:** Visualizing the spatial extent of
   program implementation areas in relation to target areas to assess
   coverage and identify gaps.

Conclusion
----------

The OpenSPP Area GIS module empowers OpenSPP with valuable GIS
capabilities for managing and visualizing geographical areas. This
integration of spatial data enhances the platform's ability to support
effective and efficient program planning, implementation, monitoring,
and evaluation for social protection programs and farmer registries.
