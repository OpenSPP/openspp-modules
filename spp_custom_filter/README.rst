OpenSPP Custom Filter
=====================

Overview
--------

The SPP Custom Filter module enhances the default Odoo filtering
functionality by allowing administrators to control which fields are
displayed in the filter dropdown menus. This is particularly useful for
complex models with a large number of fields, where displaying all
fields in the filter dropdown can be overwhelming and impact usability.

Features
--------

-  **Granular control over filterable fields:** Administrators can
   enable or disable the "Show on Custom Filter" option for individual
   fields in any model. This allows them to selectively expose only the
   most relevant fields for filtering in the user interface.

-  **Improved User Experience:** By limiting the number of fields
   displayed in the filter dropdown menus, users are presented with a
   cleaner and more focused interface. This simplifies the process of
   finding and filtering data, ultimately improving efficiency.

How it Works
------------

1. **Field Configuration:** The module adds a new boolean field, "Show
   on Custom Filter," to the field definition in the Odoo backend. By
   default, this option is disabled for all fields.

2. **Enabling Custom Filtering:** Administrators can enable the "Show on
   Custom Filter" option for specific fields within a model. Only the
   fields with this option enabled will appear in the filter dropdown
   menus for that model.

3. **User Interface Integration:** The module seamlessly integrates with
   the existing Odoo filtering mechanism. Users will see the filtered
   fields in the dropdown menus as usual, but with only the selected
   fields available.

Dependencies
------------

This module depends on the following Odoo module:

-  **base:** This module is a core Odoo module that provides the basic
   framework and functionalities.

Integration with Other Modules
------------------------------

The [SPP Custom Filter](SPP Custom Filter) module can be used with any
other Odoo module. Its functionality is generic and can be applied to
enhance the filtering experience for any model.

Example Use Case
----------------

Consider a Beneficiary model with numerous fields, such as name, age,
address, contact details, program enrollment status, payment history,
etc. Displaying all these fields in the filter dropdown menu can be
overwhelming. With the [SPP Custom Filter](SPP Custom Filter) module,
administrators can choose to display only frequently used fields for
filtering, such as name, program enrollment status, and payment status,
simplifying the user interface.

Conclusion
----------

The [SPP Custom Filter](SPP Custom Filter) module provides a simple yet
powerful solution to enhance the usability of Odoo's filtering system.
By offering administrators granular control over filterable fields, the
module improves user experience and streamlines data management within
Odoo.
