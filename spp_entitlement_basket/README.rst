OpenSPP Entitlement Basket
==========================

This document outlines the functionality of the **OpenSPP Entitlement
Basket** module. This module extends OpenSPP's program management by
introducing the concept of predefined "baskets" of goods and services
that beneficiaries are entitled to receive.

Purpose
-------

The **OpenSPP Entitlement Basket** module aims to:

-  **Define In-Kind Entitlement Baskets:** Create predefined sets of
   products (goods and services) representing a complete entitlement
   package.
-  **Simplify In-Kind Entitlement Management:** Streamline the
   assignment of multiple products to beneficiaries using a single
   basket.
-  **Integrate with Program Cycles and Inventory:** Seamlessly connect
   entitlement baskets to program cycles and leverage existing inventory
   management features.

Module Dependencies and Integration
-----------------------------------

1. `g2p_registry_base <g2p_registry_base>`__: Uses the base registry for
   core beneficiary information and links basket entitlements to
   beneficiary profiles.

2. `g2p_programs <g2p_programs>`__: Extends program management by
   introducing a new entitlement manager type for basket distribution.

3. `spp_programs <spp_programs>`__: Leverages the in-kind entitlement
   model and inventory integration features.

4. `spp_service_points <spp_service_points>`__: Associates entitlement
   baskets with service points for beneficiary redemption.

5. `product <product>`__: Utilizes the product module to define the
   goods and services included within an entitlement basket.

6. `stock <stock>`__: Integrates with the stock module to manage
   inventory levels of basket products, generate procurement requests,
   and track stock movements upon entitlement approval.

Additional Functionality
------------------------

-  **Entitlement Basket Model (spp.entitlement.basket):** Introduces a
   new model to define entitlement baskets, capturing:

   -  **Products:** A list of products included in the basket.
   -  **Quantity per Product:** The number of units of each product a
      beneficiary is entitled to.

-  **Basket Entitlement Manager
   (g2p.program.entitlement.manager.basket):**

   -  A new entitlement manager type specifically for managing basket
      distribution within a program.
   -  Associates a program cycle with a predefined entitlement basket.
   -  Allows configuration of optional multipliers based on beneficiary
      attributes (e.g., number of family members).
   -  Handles the generation of individual in-kind entitlements for each
      product in the basket based on beneficiary eligibility and
      multiplier settings.

-  **Inventory Integration:**

   -  When a basket entitlement is approved, the module leverages
      existing `spp_programs <spp_programs>`__ functionality to:

      -  Generate procurement requests for the required quantities of
         basket products within the designated warehouse.
      -  Trigger stock movements to transfer goods from the warehouse to
         the designated service point for beneficiary redemption.

-  **Beneficiary Entitlement View:** Extends the beneficiary profile to
   display a history of received entitlement baskets and the individual
   product entitlements within each basket.

Conclusion
----------

The **OpenSPP Entitlement Basket** module simplifies the management and
distribution of complex in-kind entitlements. By bundling products into
predefined baskets, it streamlines program configuration, improves
efficiency, and enhances transparency for both program administrators
and beneficiaries. The integration with existing OpenSPP modules ensures
a cohesive and robust system for managing diverse social protection
programs.
