OpenSPP OpenID VCI
==================

Overview
--------

The `spp_openid_vci <spp_openid_vci.md>`__ module enhances the
functionality of the OpenSPP platform by enabling the issuance of
Verifiable Credentials (VCs) to registrants. These VCs, based on OpenID
Connect for Verifiable Presentations (OpenID4VP) and Decentralized
Identifiers (DIDs), provide a secure and verifiable way to represent
claims about a registrant's identity or attributes.

This module builds upon the capabilities provided by several other
modules, including `spp_encryption <spp_encryption.md>`__,
`g2p_openid_vci <g2p_openid_vci.md>`__,
`g2p_registry_base <g2p_registry_base.md>`__, and
`g2p_encryption_rest_api <g2p_encryption_rest_api.md>`__, to offer a
comprehensive VC issuance solution.

Purpose
-------

This module aims to:

-  **Issue Verifiable Credentials:** Generate and issue standardized VCs
   containing information drawn from the registry data.
-  **Generate QR Codes:** Create scannable QR codes that encode the
   issued VCs, allowing for easy verification using mobile devices.
-  **Provide a User Interface:** Offer an intuitive interface within the
   OpenSPP backend for managing VCI issuers and issuing VCs to
   registrants.

Role and Integration
--------------------

The `spp_openid_vci <spp_openid_vci.md>`__ module relies on the
foundational elements provided by its dependencies:

-  `spp_encryption <spp_encryption.md>`__\ **:** Leverages this module
   to digitally sign issued VCs, ensuring their authenticity and
   integrity.
-  `g2p_openid_vci <g2p_openid_vci.md>`__\ **:** Utilizes the core VC
   issuance logic and issuer management functionalities provided by this
   module.
-  `g2p_registry_base <g2p_registry_base.md>`__\ **:** Fetches the
   necessary registrant data (name, address, etc.) from this module to
   populate the claims within the VCs.
-  `g2p_encryption_rest_api <g2p_encryption_rest_api.md>`__\ **:** This
   module is not directly utilized by
   `spp_openid_vci <spp_openid_vci.md>`__ but is essential for external
   systems to interact with the encryption and VC verification
   mechanisms.

Additional Functionality
------------------------

This module extends the capabilities of its dependencies by adding:

-  **VC QR Code Generation:** It generates and stores QR code
   representations of issued VCs, directly associating them with
   registrant records.
-  **ID Card Template:** Includes a customizable ID card template that
   incorporates the VC QR code, providing a tangible representation of a
   registrant's verifiable credentials.
-  **Issuance Wizard:** Introduces a user-friendly wizard within the
   registrant's profile to guide the VC issuance process. This wizard
   allows users to select the appropriate VCI issuer and generate the VC
   and corresponding QR code.

Example Usage Scenario:
-----------------------

1. **Configuration:** An administrator configures a VCI issuer within
   the `g2p_openid_vci <g2p_openid_vci.md>`__ module to represent their
   organization and defines the format and data fields for the VC,
   including the scope of the credential (e.g., proof of address).
2. **Data Fetching:** When a user initiates the VC issuance process for
   a registrant, the module retrieves the relevant information from the
   registrant's profile managed by
   `g2p_registry_base <g2p_registry_base.md>`__.
3. **VC Generation and Signing:** The module leverages the
   `g2p_openid_vci <g2p_openid_vci.md>`__ module to construct the VC,
   populating it with the fetched data. The VC is then digitally signed
   using the encryption provider configured in the
   `spp_encryption <spp_encryption.md>`__ module.
4. **QR Code Generation:** A QR code, encoding the signed VC, is
   generated. This QR code is then associated with the registrant's
   record.
5. **ID Card Printing (Optional):** Users can opt to print an ID card
   for the registrant, which includes the generated QR code. This
   provides a physical credential that can be easily verified using a QR
   code scanner.

Conclusion
----------

The `spp_openid_vci <spp_openid_vci>`__ module enhances OpenSPP by
providing a streamlined and user-friendly way to issue and manage
Verifiable Credentials. By integrating seamlessly with other key
modules, it enables organizations to leverage the power of VCs to
enhance trust and streamline data sharing within their ecosystems and
with external parties.
