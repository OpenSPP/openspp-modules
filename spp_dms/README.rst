OpenSPP Document Management System
==================================

Overview
--------

The `spp_dms <spp_dms>`__ module provides a robust system for organizing
and managing files within OpenSPP. This module is essential for
maintaining a structured and easily accessible repository of documents
related to social protection programs.

Features
--------

-  **Hierarchical Directories:** Organize files logically into folders
   and subfolders for easy navigation and retrieval.
-  **File Uploads:** Securely upload and store files of various formats
   within the system.
-  **Metadata Management:** Store essential information about each file,
   including file type, size, upload date, and more.
-  **File Preview:** View thumbnails and previews of common file types
   directly within the interface.
-  **Categorization:** Classify files using categories to streamline
   searching and filtering.
-  **User Roles and Permissions:** Control access to directories and
   files based on user roles to ensure data security.

Integration
-----------

While the `spp_dms <spp_dms>`__ module has no direct dependencies on
other modules, it plays a crucial role in enhancing the functionality of
other OpenSPP modules by providing a centralized document repository.

For instance, modules related to:

-  **Beneficiary Management:** Can utilize `spp_dms <spp_dms>`__ to
   store important beneficiary documents, such as identification cards,
   proof of residency, or program-specific forms.
-  **Payment Processing:** Can store payment records, receipts, or other
   financial documentation within `spp_dms <spp_dms>`__ for easy
   auditing and reference.

   evaluation reports, data collection tools, and other program-related
   documents.

By integrating seamlessly with other OpenSPP modules,
