OpenSPP Custom Field
====================

This document describes the **OpenSPP Custom Field** module, which
extends the functionality of OpenSPP by adding customizable fields to
registrant profiles. This module is specifically designed to work with
the `g2p_registry_base <g2p_registry_base>`__ module and leverages its
features for managing registrant data.

Purpose
-------

The **OpenSPP Custom Field** module enables administrators to define and
manage custom fields for capturing additional information about
registrants. This allows for greater flexibility and adaptability in
tailoring the registry system to specific program needs and data
collection requirements.

Integration with `g2p_registry_base <g2p_registry_base>`__
----------------------------------------------------------

This module directly integrates with the
`g2p_registry_base <g2p_registry_base>`__ module by extending the
functionality of the ``res.partner`` model, which is the core model for
managing registrants within OpenSPP. Instead of creating new models or
data structures, it adds custom fields directly onto the registrant
profile, ensuring data consistency and ease of management.

Key Functionality
-----------------

-  **Custom Field Creation**: Administrators can create various types of
   custom fields (e.g., text fields, booleans, dates) through Odoo's
   standard field creation mechanisms.
-  **Field Categorization**: Custom fields are categorized as either
   "Custom Details" or "Indicators." This allows for logical grouping
   and display of information within the registrant profile.
-  **Conditional Field Display**: Fields can be configured to display
   based on whether the registrant is an individual or a group, ensuring
   relevant information is presented in each context.
-  **Indicators as Read-Only**: Fields categorized as "Indicators" are
   automatically set as read-only on the user interface. This is
   particularly useful for displaying calculated metrics or data points
   derived from other system information.
-  **Seamless UI Integration**: Custom fields are integrated directly
   into the registrant profile form within the Odoo interface. This
   provides a user-friendly experience for data entry and management
   without requiring navigation to separate sections or modules.

Benefits
--------

-  **Enhanced Data Collection**: Capture program-specific information
   beyond the standard fields provided by the
   `g2p_registry_base <g2p_registry_base>`__ module.
-  **Improved Targeting and Analysis**: Utilize custom fields to segment
   registrants, analyze trends, and support data-driven decision-making.
-  **Flexibility and Adaptability**: Easily modify and extend the
   registry system to accommodate evolving program needs and data
   collection requirements.

Conclusion
----------

The **OpenSPP Custom Field** module provides a powerful and flexible way
to customize the OpenSPP registry system. By seamlessly integrating with
the `g2p_registry_base <g2p_registry_base>`__ module and leveraging
Odoo's existing framework, it empowers administrators to tailor data
collection and management processes to meet the specific requirements of
their social protection programs.
