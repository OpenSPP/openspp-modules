# OpenSPP Area

This document describes the **OpenSPP Area** module, which extends the OpenSPP framework by providing features to manage and organize geographical areas within the system.  It integrates with the core registry modules to allow associating registrants and other data with specific locations. 

## Purpose

The **OpenSPP Area** module is designed to:

* **Define and Structure Geographical Areas**: Establish a hierarchical structure for representing administrative regions, from the highest level (e.g., country) down to the most granular level (e.g., village).
* **Manage Area Information**: Store key details about each area, including its name, code, alternate names, geographical size, and parent-child relationships within the hierarchy.
* **Associate Registrants with Areas**:  Enable the linking of individual and group registrants to specific areas, facilitating location-based targeting, analysis, and program implementation. 

## Dependencies and Integration

1. **G2P Registry: Base ([g2p_registry_base](g2p_registry_base))**:  The Area module utilizes the **Districts (g2p.district)** feature from the **G2P Registry: Base** module as a foundation. It extends this concept to create a more comprehensive and flexible system for managing area data.

2. **G2P Registry: Individual ([g2p_registry_individual](g2p_registry_individual))**: Integrates with the Individual module by adding a dedicated "Area" field to the individual registrant form. This field allows users to assign a specific area to each individual, linking registrant data to geographical locations.

3. **G2P Registry: Group ([g2p_registry_group](g2p_registry_group))**:  Similar to the Individual module integration, this module incorporates an "Area" field into the group registrant form, enabling the association of groups with specific areas.

4. **Queue Job ([queue_job](queue_job))**:  Leverages the **Queue Job** module for background processing of large data imports, improving performance and user experience. This is particularly beneficial when importing extensive area hierarchies from external sources. 

## Additional Functionality

* **Hierarchical Area Structure ([spp.area](spp.area))**: 
    * Introduces a dedicated model for managing areas, allowing for the creation of multi-level administrative boundaries with parent-child relationships.
    * Computes and displays the complete area path (e.g., "Country > Province > District > Village") to provide clear context within the hierarchy.
    * Enforces unique codes for each area to ensure proper identification and prevent duplicates.

* **Area Types ([spp.area.kind](spp.area.kind))**:
    * Includes a model for defining and managing different types of areas (e.g., administrative regions, ecological zones, project implementation areas).
    * Allows for the creation of a hierarchy of area types, providing further categorization and flexibility.

* **Area Import Functionality**:
    * Provides tools for importing area data in bulk from Excel files, streamlining the process of populating the area hierarchy.
    * Implements validation rules during the import process to ensure data integrity, such as checking for required fields, data types, and hierarchical consistency.
    * Utilizes the Queue Job module to perform data validation and import operations in the background, preventing performance issues and providing a smoother user experience.
    * Ability to localize the name of the imported area.

## Conclusion

The **OpenSPP Area** module enhances the OpenSPP platform by providing a robust and flexible system for managing geographical areas and linking them to registrant data. Its integration with the core registry modules ensures that location information is seamlessly incorporated into the overall system, supporting location-based targeting, analysis, and program management for social protection programs and farmer registries.
