OpenSPP Area
============

This document describes the **OpenSPP Area** module, which extends the
OpenSPP framework by providing features to manage and organize
geographical areas within the system. It integrates with the core
registry modules to allow associating registrants and other data with
specific locations.

Purpose
-------

The **OpenSPP Area** module is designed to:

-  **Define and Structure Geographical Areas**: Establish a hierarchical
   structure for representing administrative regions, from the highest
   level (e.g., country) down to the most granular level (e.g.,
   village).
-  **Manage Area Information**: Store key details about each area,
   including its name, code, alternate names, geographical size, and
   parent-child relationships within the hierarchy.
-  **Associate Registrants with Areas**: Enable the linking of
   individual and group registrants to specific areas, facilitating
   location-based targeting, analysis, and program implementation.

Dependencies and Integration
----------------------------

1. **G2P Registry: Base
   (**\ `g2p_registry_base <g2p_registry_base>`__\ **)**: The Area
   module utilizes the **Districts (g2p.district)** feature from the
   **G2P Registry: Base** module as a foundation. It extends this
   concept to create a more comprehensive and flexible system for
   managing area data.

2. **G2P Registry: Individual
   (**\ `g2p_registry_individual <g2p_registry_individual>`__\ **)**:
   Integrates with the Individual module by adding a dedicated "Area"
   field to the individual registrant form. This field allows users to
   assign a specific area to each individual, linking registrant data to
   geographical locations.

3. **G2P Registry: Group
   (**\ `g2p_registry_group <g2p_registry_group>`__\ **)**: Similar to
   the Individual module integration, this module incorporates an "Area"
   field into the group registrant form, enabling the association of
   groups with specific areas.

4. **Queue Job (**\ `queue_job <queue_job>`__\ **)**: Leverages the
   **Queue Job** module for background processing of large data imports,
   improving performance and user experience. This is particularly
   beneficial when importing extensive area hierarchies from external
   sources.

Additional Functionality
------------------------

-  **Hierarchical Area Structure (**\ `spp.area <spp.area>`__\ **)**:

   -  Introduces a dedicated model for managing areas, allowing for the
      creation of multi-level administrative boundaries with
      parent-child relationships.
   -  Computes and displays the complete area path (e.g., "Country >
      Province > District > Village") to provide clear context within
      the hierarchy.
   -  Enforces unique codes for each area to ensure proper
      identification and prevent duplicates.

-  **Area Types (**\ `spp.area.kind <spp.area.kind>`__\ **)**:

   -  Includes a model for defining and managing different types of
      areas (e.g., administrative regions, ecological zones, project
      implementation areas).
   -  Allows for the creation of a hierarchy of area types, providing
      further categorization and flexibility.

-  **Area Import Functionality**:

   -  Provides tools for importing area data in bulk from Excel files,
      streamlining the process of populating the area hierarchy.
   -  Implements validation rules during the import process to ensure
      data integrity, such as checking for required fields, data types,
      and hierarchical consistency.
   -  Utilizes the Queue Job module to perform data validation and
      import operations in the background, preventing performance issues
      and providing a smoother user experience.
   -  Ability to localize the name of the imported area.

Conclusion
----------

The **OpenSPP Area** module enhances the OpenSPP platform by providing a
robust and flexible system for managing geographical areas and linking
them to registrant data. Its integration with the core registry modules
ensures that location information is seamlessly incorporated into the
overall system, supporting location-based targeting, analysis, and
program management for social protection programs and farmer registries.
