OpenSPP Programs
================

This document outlines the functionality of the **OpenSPP Programs**
module. This module extends the **OpenG2P: Programs** functionality,
introducing in-kind entitlement management alongside existing cash-based
features.

Purpose
-------

The **OpenSPP Programs** module aims to:

-  **Manage In-Kind Entitlements**: Introduce the concept of in-kind
   entitlements alongside cash entitlements, allowing programs to
   distribute goods and services.
-  **Integrate with Inventory**: Link in-kind entitlements to the Odoo
   Inventory module, enabling stock management, procurement, and
   tracking of distributed items.
-  **Enhance Existing Program Features**: Extend OpenG2P's program
   management with capabilities tailored for in-kind distributions.

Module Dependencies and Integration
-----------------------------------

1. `g2p_registry_base <g2p_registry_base>`__ : Leverages the base
   registry for core registrant information and extends it by adding
   in-kind entitlement tracking to registrant profiles.

2. `g2p_programs <g2p_programs>`__:

   -  Builds upon the core program management features, including
      program creation, cycle management, and eligibility determination.
   -  Extends program views to incorporate in-kind entitlement data and
      actions.

3. `spp_area <spp_area>`__: Integrates with the area module to associate
   service points for in-kind entitlement redemption with specific
   geographical areas.

4. **Product (product)**: Utilizes the product module to define the
   goods and services offered as part of in-kind entitlements,
   leveraging existing product information and categorization.

5. **Stock (stock)**:

   -  Links in-kind entitlements to the stock module, enabling the
      generation of stock movements upon entitlement approval.
   -  Allows for the tracking of inventory levels, procurement needs,
      and the flow of goods from warehouses to beneficiaries.

Additional Functionality
------------------------

-  **In-Kind Entitlement Model (g2p.entitlement.inkind)**: Introduces a
   new model specifically for managing in-kind entitlements, capturing
   data such as:

   -  **Product**: The specific good or service being distributed.
   -  **Quantity**: The number of units entitled to the beneficiary.
   -  **Unit Price**: The value of each unit for accounting and
      reporting.
   -  **Warehouse**: The location from which the item will be
      distributed.
   -  **Service Point**: The designated point where beneficiaries can
      redeem their entitlements.

-  **Inventory Integration**:

   -  When an in-kind entitlement is approved:

      -  A procurement request is automatically generated within the
         stock module.
      -  Stock movements are triggered to transfer the goods from the
         warehouse to the designated service point.

-  **Extended Program Views**:

   -  Program views are modified to display both cash and in-kind
      entitlement counts.
   -  New tabs and fields within program forms provide visibility into
      in-kind entitlement details.

-  **Registrant Profile Enhancements**:

   -  Registrant profiles now include a dedicated section for tracking
      in-kind entitlements, listing past and current entitlements.
   -  Provides a consolidated view of a registrant's benefits,
      encompassing both cash and in-kind distributions.

-  **Reporting**:

   -  The module includes new reports specifically designed for in-kind
      entitlements, providing insights into:

      -  Distribution of goods and services.
      -  Inventory levels and procurement needs.
      -  Service point activity and redemption rates.

Conclusion
----------

The **OpenSPP Programs** module significantly expands the OpenG2P
platform's capabilities by incorporating in-kind entitlement management.
This integration with inventory management and the enhancements to
existing program features make OpenSPP a comprehensive solution for
managing a wider range of social protection and agricultural support
programs.
