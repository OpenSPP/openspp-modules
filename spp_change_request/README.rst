OpenSPP Change Request
======================

Overview
--------

The OpenSPP Change Request (`spp_change_request <spp_change_request>`__)
module streamlines the process of handling changes to registrant
information within the OpenSPP system. It provides a structured
framework for submitting, reviewing, approving, and applying
modifications to existing registrant data.

Purpose
-------

The module aims to:

-  **Formalize Change Requests**: Introduce a standardized procedure for
   requesting alterations to registrant data, ensuring all changes are
   documented and tracked.
-  **Implement a Multi-Step Approval Process**: Establish a configurable
   workflow for validating and authorizing change requests, involving
   different user roles and levels of approval.
-  **Maintain Data Integrity**: Safeguard the accuracy and consistency
   of registrant information by requiring proper justification and
   authorization for any modifications.
-  **Enhance Transparency and Accountability**: Provide a clear audit
   trail of all change requests, approvals, and applications, promoting
   transparency and accountability in data management.

Module Dependencies and Integration
-----------------------------------

The `spp_change_request <spp_change_request>`__ module leverages and
extends the functionality of several other OpenSPP modules:

1. **G2P Registry Modules**: It heavily relies on the G2P Registry
   modules for accessing and modifying registrant data:

   -  **G2P Registry: Base
      (**\ `g2p_registry_base <g2p_registry_base>`__\ **)**: Inherits
      core registrant management features, including the ``res.partner``
      model used to represent registrants.
   -  **G2P Registry: Individual
      (**\ `g2p_registry_individual <g2p_registry_individual>`__\ **)**:
      Integrates with the individual registrant model to handle change
      requests related to individual data.
   -  **G2P Registry: Group
      (**\ `g2p_registry_group <g2p_registry_group>`__\ **)**: Extends
      group registrant functionality to manage changes related to group
      information.
   -  **G2P Registry: Membership
      (**\ `g2p_registry_membership <g2p_registry_membership>`__\ **)**:
      Allows for change requests involving membership details, such as
      adding or removing members from groups.

2. **OpenSPP Service Points
   (**\ `spp_service_points <spp_service_points>`__\ **)**: Integrates
   with the Service Points module to enable the submission of change
   requests through designated service points.

3. **OpenSPP Area (**\ `spp_area <spp_area>`__\ **)**: Utilizes the Area
   module to manage change requests related to a registrant's
   geographical location, such as changes in address or district.

4. **OpenSPP Scan ID Document
   (**\ `spp_scan_id_document <spp_scan_id_document>`__\ **)**:
   Integrates with the ID scanning functionality to allow for the
   capture and association of scanned documents as supporting evidence
   for change requests.

5. **OpenSPP DMS (**\ `spp_dms <spp_dms>`__\ **)**: Leverages the
   Document Management System for storing and managing documents related
   to change requests, such as proof of identity, address verification,
   or other supporting materials.

6. **Phone Validation (``phone_validation``)**: Utilizes the phone
   validation module to ensure phone number updates within change
   requests adhere to proper formatting and validation rules.

Additional Functionality
------------------------

Change Request Management
-------------------------

-  **Change Request Model (``spp.change.request``)**: A central model
   for tracking all change requests, storing details like request type,
   status, applicant, assigned personnel, approval history, and related
   documents.
-  **Configurable Workflow**: Supports customizable multi-stage approval
   processes, allowing administrators to define the required steps and
   user roles involved in validating change requests.
-  **Status Tracking**: Monitors the progress of change requests through
   various states (Draft, Pending Validation, Validated, Applied,
   Rejected, Cancelled), providing real-time visibility into the
   process.
-  **Audit Trail**: Maintains a comprehensive history of all actions
   related to a change request, including submission, validation,
   approvals, rejections, and application, ensuring accountability and
   transparency.

Integration with Registrant Data
--------------------------------

-  **Dynamic Form Generation**: The module allows for defining different
   change request types, each associated with a specific form that
   captures the necessary data for that type of modification.
-  **Data Validation**: Implements validation rules to ensure the data
   entered in change request forms meet specific criteria, such as data
   type, format, or range, before submission for approval.
-  **Automatic Data Update**: Upon approval and application of a change
   request, the module automatically updates the corresponding
   registrant data in the relevant G2P Registry module, ensuring data
   consistency.

User Interface and Experience
-----------------------------

-  **Dedicated Change Request Menu**: Provides a centralized location
   within the OpenSPP interface for accessing and managing change
   requests.
-  **User-Friendly Forms**: Offers intuitive and easy-to-use forms for
   submitting different types of change requests, guiding users through
   the required information.
-  **Role-Based Access Control**: Restricts access to change request
   functionalities based on user roles and permissions, ensuring data
   security and appropriate authorization levels.

Conclusion
----------

The OpenSPP Change Request module significantly strengthens the data
management capabilities of OpenSPP by introducing a structured and
controlled mechanism for handling modifications to registrant
information. By integrating with various core modules, the
`spp_change_request <spp_change_request>`__ module promotes data
integrity, transparency, and accountability throughout the change
management process.
