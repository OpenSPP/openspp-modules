OpenSPP Base GIS
================

Overview
--------

The OpenSPP Base GIS module enhances the functionality of OpenSPP by
adding Geographical Information System (GIS) capabilities. It provides
the foundation for visualizing and interacting with geospatial data
within the OpenSPP platform. This module depends on the following Odoo
modules:

-  **contacts:** Used to manage contact information.
-  **web:** Provides the core web framework for building user
   interfaces.

Functionality
-------------

The Base GIS module introduces several key features:

-  **GIS Views:** Allows the creation of specialized views within
   OpenSPP models to display geospatial data on interactive maps. These
   views are defined using the "gis" type in the view definition.

-  **Raster Layers:** Supports the integration of background maps from
   various sources, including:

   -  Distant Web Map Service (WMS)
   -  OpenStreetMap
   -  Static images

-  **Data Layers:** Enables the visualization of data from OpenSPP
   models directly on the map. Users can configure:

   -  The geometric representation of data (e.g., points, lines,
      polygons)
   -  The field containing the geographic data
   -  Styling options such as colors and opacity

-  **Spatial Queries:** Provides tools for performing spatial queries to
   filter data based on geographic relationships such as intersection
   and distance.

Integration
-----------

The Base GIS module seamlessly integrates with other OpenSPP modules by
extending the core functionality with geospatial awareness. For
instance:

-  `Registries <Registries>`__ The module allows for visualizing
   registry data on a map. This could include plotting the locations of
   farmers, beneficiaries, or other entities managed within a registry.
-  **[Targeting and Eligibility](Targeting and Eligibility)** GIS data
   can be incorporated into targeting and eligibility rules. For
   example, a program might define eligibility based on a beneficiary's
   location within a specific geographical area.
-  **[Monitoring and Evaluation](Monitoring and Evaluation)** The module
   facilitates spatial analysis for monitoring and evaluation purposes.
   Program implementers can visualize program coverage, identify
   geographic areas with high or low program participation, and track
   progress over time.

Configuration
-------------

The Base GIS module can be configured through:

-  **GIS Views:** Defining GIS views for specific models to control how
   geospatial data is displayed.
-  **Raster Layers:** Adding and configuring background maps from
   different sources.
-  **Data Layers:** Setting up data layers to visualize model data on
   the map with customized styles.

Example Use Case
----------------

Consider a social protection program where beneficiaries are registered
along with their geolocation data. The Base GIS module can be used to:

1. Create a GIS view for the beneficiary model to display their
   locations on a map.
2. Overlay data layers representing program intervention areas to
   visualize program coverage.
3. Perform spatial queries to identify beneficiaries residing within or
   outside specific zones.

This information can be used for program planning, targeting,
monitoring, and evaluation.

Conclusion
----------

The OpenSPP Base GIS module empowers OpenSPP with powerful geospatial
capabilities, enabling users to visualize, analyze, and interact with
data in new and insightful ways. This strengthens the platform's ability
to support effective and efficient social protection programs and farmer
registries.
