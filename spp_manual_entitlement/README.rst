OpenSPP Manual Entitlement
==========================

This document describes the **OpenSPP Manual Entitlement** module, which
extends the OpenSPP system to allow for manual entitlement creation
within social protection programs.

Purpose
-------

The **OpenSPP Manual Entitlement** module aims to:

-  **Enable Manual Entitlement Creation:** Provide a mechanism for
   program administrators to manually generate entitlements for
   beneficiaries in cases where automated processes are not suitable.
   This is particularly useful for programs with specific eligibility
   criteria or where beneficiary data might not be readily available for
   automated processing.

-  **Integrate with Existing Program Cycles:** Seamlessly integrate with
   the existing program cycle structure in OpenSPP, allowing for manual
   entitlement creation within defined cycle periods.

-  **Enhance Flexibility in Entitlement Management:** Offer a more
   flexible approach to entitlement management, accommodating situations
   where automated rules might not cover all beneficiary scenarios.

Dependencies and Integration
----------------------------

1. **Queue Job** (`queue_job <queue_job>`__): Utilizes the Queue Job
   module for asynchronous processing of entitlement creation,
   preventing performance issues when handling large numbers of
   beneficiaries.

2. **G2P Registry: Base** (`g2p_registry_base <g2p_registry_base>`__):
   Depends on the G2P Registry: Base module to access and manage
   registrant data, ensuring that entitlements are linked to the correct
   beneficiary profiles.

3. **OpenSPP Registrant Import**
   (`spp_registrant_import <spp_registrant_import>`__): Integrates with
   the OpenSPP Registrant Import module to potentially streamline the
   process of importing beneficiary lists for manual entitlement
   creation.

4. **G2P Programs** (`g2p_programs <g2p_programs>`__): Extends the G2P
   Programs module by adding functionality to create manual entitlements
   within the existing program and cycle structures.

Additional Functionality
------------------------

-  **Manual Entitlement Wizard:**

   -  Introduces a wizard that guides users through the manual
      entitlement creation process.
   -  Allows selection of a specific program cycle for which to create
      entitlements.
   -  Provides an interface to either select existing beneficiaries or
      import a list of beneficiaries for entitlement generation.
   -  Includes a step to review and confirm entitlement details before
      creation.

-  **Manual Entitlement Manager:**

   -  Extends the ``g2p.program.entitlement.manager.default`` model to
      include a flag ``is_manual_cash``.
   -  Adds a method ``manual_prepare_entitlements`` to handle the
      creation of entitlements based on data provided through the
      wizard.

-  **Cycle View Extension:**

   -  Modifies the program cycle view to include a button to trigger the
      manual entitlement wizard.
   -  Provides a visual cue within the cycle view to indicate if manual
      entitlement is enabled for the program.

Conclusion
----------

The **OpenSPP Manual Entitlement** module enhances the flexibility of
OpenSPP's entitlement management system. By enabling manual entitlement
creation, it empowers program administrators to handle situations where
automated rules might not be sufficient, ensuring that all eligible
beneficiaries receive their entitled benefits. This module contributes
to a more inclusive and adaptable social protection program
implementation.
