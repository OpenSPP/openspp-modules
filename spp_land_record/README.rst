OpenSPP Land Record
===================

Overview
--------

The **OpenSPP: Land Record** module extends OpenSPP's capabilities to
manage and visualize land records. Building upon the [G2P Registry:
Base](G2P Registry: Base) and [OpenSPP Base GIS](G2P Registry:
Base](OpenSPP Base GIS](G2P Registry: Base) and [OpenSPP Base GIS)
modules, it provides a framework for recording land parcels, ownership
details, lease agreements, and visualizing these records geospatially.

Purpose
-------

This module is designed to:

-  Record essential details of land parcels, including size,
   coordinates, and usage.
-  Link land parcels to specific farms and registrants in the OpenSPP
   system.
-  Track land ownership and lease arrangements.
-  Visualize land records on maps, leveraging the GIS capabilities of
   OpenSPP.

Functionality and Integration
-----------------------------

**OpenSPP: Land Record** extends existing modules with the following
features:

1. **Land Record Model (``spp.land.record``):** This core model stores
   information about each land parcel, including:

   -  **Link to Farm:** Connects the land record to a specific farm
      (``res.partner``) in the system.
   -  **Parcel Details:** Records the parcel's name/ID, acreage,
      coordinates (point and polygon), and land use type.
   -  **Ownership and Lease:** Links to owner and lessee records (using
      ``res.partner``), along with lease start and end dates.

2. **Integration with [G2P Registry Base](G2P Registry Base):**

   -  Leverages the ``res.partner`` model from [G2P Registry Base](G2P
      Registry Base) to link land records with existing farms, owners,
      and lessees.
   -  Benefits from the robust identification, relationship management,
      and tagging features provided by [G2P Registry Base](G2P Registry
      Base).

3. **Geospatial Visualization:**

   -  Integrates with the [OpenSPP Base GIS](OpenSPP Base GIS) module to
      visualize land records on maps.
   -  Provides a ``get_geojson`` method to generate GeoJSON
      representations of land records, enabling their display as data
      layers on maps.
   -  Allows users to visualize land parcels, ownership boundaries, and
      other land-related information in a spatial context.

Example Use Cases:
------------------

-  **Land Tenure Mapping:** Visualize landholding patterns within a
   region, identifying potential issues related to land fragmentation,
   insecure tenure, or land disputes.
-  **Program Targeting:** Design targeted interventions by identifying
   farmers or beneficiaries based on land use, size of holdings, or
   ownership status.
-  **Monitoring Land Use Change:** Track changes in land use over time
   (e.g., conversion of forest to agricultural land), supporting
   environmental monitoring and sustainable land management initiatives.

Conclusion
----------

The **OpenSPP: Land Record** module enhances OpenSPP's capacity to
manage and analyze land-related data. By integrating with core registry
and GIS functionalities, it provides a valuable tool for policymakers,
program implementers, and researchers working on land governance,
agricultural development, and social protection in the context of low-
and middle-income countries.
