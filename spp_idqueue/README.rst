OpenSPP ID Queue
================

This document outlines the **OpenSPP ID Queue** module within the
OpenSPP ecosystem. This module adds functionality for managing requests
for printed identification cards for registrants. It integrates with
other OpenSPP modules to provide a seamless workflow from ID request to
printing and distribution.

Purpose
-------

The **OpenSPP ID Queue** module is designed to:

-  **Streamline ID Card Requests**: Provide a structured process for
   users to request printed ID cards for registrants, including the
   ability to select specific ID card templates.
-  **Implement Approval Workflows**: Incorporate optional approval steps
   for ID card requests, ensuring that requests are reviewed and
   authorized before generation.
-  **Facilitate Batch Printing**: Group ID card requests into batches
   for efficient printing and distribution, especially for large-scale
   programs.
-  **Track ID Card Status**: Monitor the progress of ID card requests
   through various stages (new, approved, generating, printed,
   distributed), providing transparency and accountability.

Dependencies and Integration
----------------------------

1. `g2p_registry_base <g2p_registry_base>`__ (G2P Registry: Base): The
   ID Queue module relies on the **Registrant (res.partner)** model from
   the **G2P Registry: Base** module to identify and link ID card
   requests to specific registrants.

2. `spp_idpass <spp_idpass>`__ (OpenSPP ID PASS): It integrates tightly
   with the **OpenSPP ID PASS** module, utilizing the predefined ID card
   templates and the ID generation mechanism.

3. `queue_job <queue_job>`__ (Queue Job): Leverages the **Queue Job**
   module for background processing of ID card generation, particularly
   when handling large batches, to avoid impacting system performance.

4. `spp_area <spp_area>`__ (OpenSPP Area): Integrates with the **OpenSPP
   Area** module to associate ID card requests with specific
   geographical areas, enabling location-based reporting and
   distribution management.

5. `g2p_registry_group <g2p_registry_group>`__ (G2P Registry: Group):
   Incorporates functionality from the **G2P Registry: Group** module to
   support ID card requests and batch printing for groups of
   registrants.

Additional Functionality
------------------------

-  **ID Request Queue (``spp.print.queue.id``)**:

   -  Introduces a dedicated model to manage individual ID card
      requests, storing request details, associated registrant, selected
      template, request status, and approval information.
   -  Provides functions to move requests through the workflow: approve,
      generate, print, distribute, and cancel.
   -  Implements a messaging system to record actions taken on requests,
      enhancing auditability.

-  **ID Print Batch (``spp.print.queue.batch``)**:

   -  Enables the grouping of approved ID requests into batches for
      streamlined printing.
   -  Offers functionalities to approve, generate, print, and mark
      batches as distributed.
   -  Includes a status tracking system for batches, mirroring the
      individual request statuses.

-  **Auto-Approve Configuration**:

   -  Allows administrators to configure the system to automatically
      approve ID requests upon creation, potentially bypassing the
      manual approval step for specific workflows.

-  **Registrant Integration**:

   -  Extends the **Registrant (``res.partner``)** model to include a
      link to all associated ID card requests, providing a centralized
      view of a registrant's ID card history.

Conclusion
----------

The **OpenSPP ID Queue** module enhances OpenSPP's ID card management
capabilities by providing a structured and efficient system for handling
ID card requests, approvals, batch printing, and distribution tracking.
Its integration with other core OpenSPP modules ensures a cohesive and
streamlined experience for managing registrant identification within
social protection programs and farmer registries.
