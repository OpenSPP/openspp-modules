OpenSPP OpenID VCI Group
========================

Overview
--------

The ``spp_openid_vci_group`` module extends the functionality of the
`spp_openid_vci <spp_openid_vci>`__ module to enable the issuance of
Verifiable Credentials (VCs) specifically for groups of registrants,
building upon the group management capabilities provided by the
`g2p_registry_group <g2p_registry_group>`__ module to enable the
issuance of Verifiable Credentials (VCs) specifically for groups of
registrants, building upon the group management capabilities provided by
the `g2p_registry_group <g2p_registry_group>`__ module. This module
leverages the existing VC issuance framework to provide a streamlined
process for issuing VCs that represent a group's identity and
attributes.

Purpose
-------

This module's primary purpose is to:

-  **Issue Group-Specific VCs:** Generate and issue VCs that contain
   information relevant to a registered group, such as the group's name,
   type, members, or other relevant attributes.
-  **Integrate with Group Management:** Seamlessly integrate with the
   group management functionality provided by the
   `g2p_registry_group <g2p_registry_group>`__ module, allowing users to
   issue VCs directly from a group's profile.

Role and Integration
--------------------

The ``spp_openid_vci_group`` module works in conjunction with the
following modules:

-  `spp_openid_vci <spp_openid_vci>`__\ **:** Inherits the core VC
   issuance logic, issuer management, and QR code generation
   functionality from this module, ensuring consistency in the issuance
   process for both individuals and groups.
-  `g2p_registry_group <g2p_registry_group>`__\ **:** Fetches
   group-related data, such as group type and member information, to
   populate the claims within the VCs. The module also integrates into
   the group profile view to provide a user-friendly way to issue VCs.

Additional Functionality
------------------------

-  **Group VCI Issuer Type:** Introduces a new "GroupRegistry" issuer
   type within the VCI issuer settings, allowing administrators to
   configure issuers specifically for generating group-related VCs.
-  **Group-Specific VC Issuance:** Modifies the VC issuance logic to
   accommodate group-related data, ensuring that the issued VCs contain
   information specific to the group, such as group name, type, and
   potentially a list of members.
-  **Group Profile Integration:** Adds a button to the group profile
   view within the `g2p_registry_group <g2p_registry_group>`__ module to
   initiate the VC issuance process directly from the group's record.

Example Usage Scenario
----------------------

1. **Configuration:** An administrator configures a VCI issuer with the
   type "GroupRegistry" and specifies the data fields for the group VC,
   including the group name, type, and any other relevant attributes.
2. **Data Retrieval:** When a user initiates the VC issuance process for
   a group, the module retrieves the necessary information from the
   group's record, including the group's name, type, and potentially a
   list of its members.
3. **VC Generation:** The module utilizes the inherited functionality
   from `spp_openid_vci <spp_openid_vci>`__ to generate the VC,
   populating it with the retrieved group-specific data. The VC is then
   digitally signed to ensure its integrity.
4. **QR Code Generation:** A QR code representing the issued VC is
   generated and associated with the group's record.
5. **Presentation on Group Profile:** The generated VC or its QR code
   representation can be displayed on the group's profile within the
   registry, allowing for easy access and verification.

Conclusion
----------

The ``spp_openid_vci_group`` module enhances OpenSPP's Verifiable
Credential issuance capabilities by extending them to groups of
registrants. It leverages the existing VC infrastructure and seamlessly
integrates with the group management functionality to provide a
streamlined process for issuing and managing group-specific VCs. This
integration further strengthens OpenSPP's ability to provide secure and
verifiable digital identities within its ecosystem, encompassing both
individual and group-level representations.
