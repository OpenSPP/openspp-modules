OpenSPP Program Entitlement Basic Cash Spent
============================================

This document details the **SPP Program Entitlement Basic Cash Spent**
module within the OpenSPP platform. This module extends the
functionality of the `g2p_programs <g2p_programs>`__ module to
specifically handle the tracking of cash spent for basic cash
entitlement programs.

Purpose
-------

The **SPP Program Entitlement Basic Cash Spent** module provides a
straightforward mechanism for:

-  **Tracking Cash Spending**: Allows program administrators to record
   the amount of cash spent by beneficiaries against their allocated
   entitlements.
-  **Calculating Remaining Balances**: Automatically calculates the
   remaining balance for each entitlement based on the initial amount
   and the recorded spending.
-  **Monitoring Entitlement Utilization**: Facilitates the monitoring of
   how beneficiaries are utilizing their allocated cash benefits.

Module Dependencies and Integration
-----------------------------------

1. **G2P Registry: Base
   (**\ `g2p_registry_base <g2p_registry_base>`__\ **)**: Inherits core
   registry functionality for managing beneficiary information.
2. `g2p_programs <g2p_programs>`__:

   -  Extends the **Entitlement (g2p.entitlement)** model to include
      cash spending tracking.
   -  Leverages program and cycle structures for organizing and managing
      entitlements.

Additional Functionality
------------------------

-  **Spent Amount Tracking**: Introduces a new field, ``spent_amount``,
   within the **Entitlement (g2p.entitlement)** model to record the
   amount of cash spent by the beneficiary.
-  **Automatic Balance Calculation**: Automatically computes the
   remaining balance (``balance``) for each entitlement by subtracting
   the ``spent_amount`` from the ``initial_amount``.
-  **Currency Support**: Utilizes the existing ``currency_id`` field
   from the **Entitlement** model to ensure accurate tracking of
   spending in the appropriate currency.

Integration with Other Modules
------------------------------

This module seamlessly integrates with the
`g2p_programs <g2p_programs>`__ module by directly extending the
**Entitlement** model. This integration allows for:

-  **Centralized Entitlement Management**: Cash spending information is
   directly associated with the corresponding entitlement record within
   the program cycle.
-  **Streamlined Reporting**: Enables the generation of reports that
   combine entitlement data (initial amount, validity period) with
   spending information (spent amount, balance).
-  **Enhanced Monitoring and Evaluation**: Provides program
   administrators with a comprehensive view of entitlement utilization,
   supporting better decision-making and program adjustments.

Conclusion
----------

The **SPP Program Entitlement Basic Cash Spent** module offers a simple
yet effective solution for tracking cash spending within basic cash
entitlement programs. By extending the core functionality of the
`g2p_programs <g2p_programs>`__ module, it ensures seamless integration
and enhances the overall management and monitoring of program benefits.
