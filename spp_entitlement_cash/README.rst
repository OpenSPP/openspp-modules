OpenSPP Cash Entitlement
========================

This document outlines the functionality of the **OpenSPP Program
Entitlement (Cash)** module. This module extends the **G2P Programs**
module, providing specialized features for managing cash-based
entitlements within social protection programs.

Purpose
-------

The **OpenSPP Program Entitlement (Cash)** module enables the
definition, calculation, and management of cash entitlements for
beneficiaries enrolled in social protection programs. It streamlines the
process of determining eligibility, calculating entitlement amounts
based on predefined rules, and facilitating the disbursement of funds.

Module Dependencies and Integration
-----------------------------------

1. **G2P Registry: Base
   (**\ `g2p_registry_base <g2p_registry_base>`__\ **\ (LINK_TO_G2P_REGISTRY_BASE))**:
   This module utilizes the base registry to access and manage
   beneficiary data, ensuring that entitlements are linked to the
   correct individuals or households.

2. **G2P Programs
   (**\ `g2p_programs <g2p_programs>`__\ **\ (LINK_TO_G2P_PROGRAMS))**:
   This module builds upon the core program management features,
   including program creation, cycle management, and eligibility
   determination. The cash entitlement module extends this functionality
   by adding cash-specific entitlement management capabilities.

3. **OpenSPP Programs
   (**\ `spp_programs <spp_programs>`__\ **\ (LINK_TO_SPP_PROGRAMS))**:
   This module provides the framework for managing both cash and in-kind
   entitlements. The cash entitlement module specializes in handling the
   complexities of cash-based distributions, integrating seamlessly with
   the broader entitlement management system.

4. **Queue Job
   (**\ `queue_job <queue_job>`__\ **\ (LINK_TO_QUEUE_JOB))**: To
   enhance performance and user experience, this module employs the
   queue job framework for asynchronous processing of computationally
   intensive tasks, such as:

   -  Calculating entitlement amounts for large numbers of
      beneficiaries.
   -  Generating payment batches for disbursement.
   -  Updating beneficiary records with entitlement and payment
      information.

Additional Functionality
------------------------

-  **Cash Entitlement Manager Model
   (``g2p.program.entitlement.manager.cash``)**:

   -  Extends the generic entitlement manager model
      (``g2p.program.entitlement.manager``) to provide cash-specific
      configurations and functionalities.
   -  Allows program administrators to define flexible rules for
      calculating cash entitlement amounts, including:

      -  **Fixed amounts**: Distribute a predetermined sum to all
         eligible beneficiaries.
      -  **Variable amounts**: Calculate entitlements dynamically based
         on beneficiary attributes (e.g., number of dependents, income
         level) using multipliers and conditions.
      -  **Maximum amounts**: Set upper limits on entitlement amounts to
         ensure equitable distribution of funds.

-  **Entitlement Item Model
   (``g2p.program.entitlement.manager.cash.item``)**:

   -  Defines individual entitlement rules within a cash entitlement
      manager.
   -  Allows for multiple calculation rules to be combined within a
      single entitlement manager, providing granular control over
      entitlement distribution.

-  **Automated Entitlement Calculation**:

   -  Automates the process of calculating cash entitlements for
      eligible beneficiaries based on the defined rules, reducing manual
      effort and minimizing errors.

-  **Entitlement Validation and Approval**:

   -  Provides mechanisms for reviewing and validating calculated
      entitlements before disbursement.
   -  Optionally integrates with user groups and permissions to enforce
      approval workflows and ensure accountability.

-  **Fund Management**:

   -  Can integrate with accounting modules to track program funds,
      monitor balances, and ensure sufficient resources for
      disbursement.
   -  May include features to prevent overspending or to alert
      administrators of potential funding shortfalls.

-  **Payment Processing**:

   -  Facilitates the generation of payment batches for disbursing cash
      entitlements to beneficiaries through various channels, such as:

      -  Bank transfers
      -  Mobile money
      -  Cash pickup points

   -  Tracks payment status and provides reconciliation tools to manage
      disbursements effectively.

Conclusion
----------

The **OpenSPP Program Entitlement (Cash)** module provides a specialized
toolkit for managing cash-based social assistance within a broader
social protection program. Its integration with other OpenSPP modules
and its flexible rule-based system make it a valuable asset for
organizations seeking to deliver cash transfers efficiently and
transparently.
