OpenSPP Registry Group Hierarchy
================================

This module builds upon the existing OpenSPP group and membership
management functionalities to introduce a hierarchical structure for
groups. It allows groups to be nested within other groups, creating a
parent-child relationship between them. This hierarchy is beneficial for
representing complex organizational structures within social protection
programs or farmer registries.

Purpose
-------

The **SPP Registry Group Hierarchy** module aims to:

-  **Enable Group Nesting**: Allow groups to be members of other groups,
   creating a multi-level hierarchical structure.
-  **Flexible Membership**: Allow both individuals and groups to be
   members of a group, providing flexibility in representing different
   organizational models.
-  **Enhanced Data Management**: Improve the organization and management
   of groups by providing a visual representation of the group
   hierarchy.

Dependencies and Integration
----------------------------

1. **G2P Registry: Base
   (**\ `g2p_registry_base <g2p_registry_base>`__\ **)**: Inherits core
   registry functionalities for managing registrant information, IDs,
   and relationships.

2. **G2P Registry: Group
   (**\ `g2p_registry_group <g2p_registry_group>`__\ **)**: Leverages
   the group model to represent both parent and child groups within the
   hierarchy.

3. **G2P Registry: Individual
   (**\ `g2p_registry_individual <g2p_registry_individual>`__\ **)**:
   Uses the individual model to maintain individual memberships within
   groups, regardless of the group's position in the hierarchy.

4. **G2P Registry: Membership
   (**\ `g2p_registry_membership <g2p_registry_membership>`__\ **)**:
   Extends the membership functionality to allow groups to be members of
   other groups, establishing the parent-child relationship.

Additional Functionality
------------------------

-  **Flexible Group Membership (``g2p.group.kind``)**:

   -  Introduces a new field (``allow_all_member_type``) in the
      ``g2p.group.kind`` model.
   -  This field allows administrators to define whether a specific
      group type can have both individual and group members.

-  **Dynamic Individual Domain (``g2p.group.membership``)**:

   -  Modifies the individual selection field within the
      ``g2p.group.membership`` model to dynamically adjust its options
      based on the group's type.
   -  If a group type allows both individual and group members, the
      individual selection field will display all registrants (excluding
      the group itself to prevent circular relationships).
   -  If a group type only allows individual members, the field will
      display only individuals.

-  **Unified Member View (``g2p.group.membership``)**:

   -  Introduces a modified form view for ``g2p.group.membership``.
   -  This view provides a unified interface for managing both
      individual and group memberships within a parent group.
   -  It dynamically displays relevant information based on whether the
      member is an individual or another group.

-  **Enhanced User Interface**:

   -  Extends the group form view to visually represent the group
      hierarchy, allowing users to easily navigate between parent and
      child groups.
   -  Provides clear indicators of a group's parent and child groups.

Conclusion
----------

The **SPP Registry Group Hierarchy** module adds significant value to
OpenSPP by introducing the concept of nested groups. This allows for a
more accurate and organized representation of complex structures
commonly found in social protection programs and farmer cooperatives.
The module integrates seamlessly with existing OpenSPP components,
providing a user-friendly experience for managing multi-level group
structures.
