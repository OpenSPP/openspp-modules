Module: g2p_connect_demo
========================

Overview
--------

The ``g2p_connect_demo`` module serves as a demonstration and testing
ground for the OpenSPP system, particularly showcasing the capabilities
of the G2P Connect system. This module is not intended for production
use but rather for development, testing, and demonstration purposes.

Purpose
-------

The primary purpose of ``g2p_connect_demo`` is to:

-  **Generate Sample Data:** Provide a mechanism to create realistic but
   anonymized sample data for registries, individuals, groups, and
   change requests. This data can be used to populate the OpenSPP system
   for testing, training, and demonstration purposes.
-  **Showcase System Functionality:** Demonstrate the integration and
   interaction between different OpenSPP modules in a realistic
   scenario. This includes modules related to registry management
   (`g2p_registry_base <g2p_registry_base>`__), individual and group
   registration (`g2p_registry_individual <g2p_registry_individual>`__,
   `g2p_registry_group <g2p_registry_group>`__,
   `g2p_registry_membership <g2p_registry_membership>`__), programs
   (`g2p_programs <g2p_programs>`__), and custom fields
   (`spp_custom_field <spp_custom_field>`__).
-  **Facilitate Testing and Development:** Provide a controlled
   environment with pre-populated data to facilitate the testing and
   development of new features and modifications to the OpenSPP system.

Key Features
------------

-  Generates a configurable number of groups and individuals with
   realistic demographic data.
-  Creates various relationships between individuals within groups,
   simulating households or families.
-  Populates custom fields with relevant data to illustrate the
   flexibility of the system.
-  Includes functionalities to generate change requests, mimicking
   real-world scenarios like adding children to a household.

Integration with other modules
------------------------------

``g2p_connect_demo`` builds upon the foundation laid by several other
OpenSPP modules:

-  `spp_base_demo <spp_base_demo>`__\ **:** Utilizes the base demo
   module for generating localized sample data.
-  **Registry Modules:** Leverages the functionality of
   `g2p_registry_base <g2p_registry_base>`__,
   `g2p_registry_individual <g2p_registry_individual>`__,
   `g2p_registry_group <g2p_registry_group>`__, and
   `g2p_registry_membership <g2p_registry_membership>`__ to create and
   manage individuals, groups, and their relationships.
-  `g2p_programs <g2p_programs>`__\ **:** Integrates with program
   definitions to simulate the enrollment of generated individuals and
   groups into social protection programs.
-  `spp_custom_field <spp_custom_field>`__\ **:** Utilizes the custom
   field framework to demonstrate how additional data points can be
   captured and managed within the registry.

Usage
-----

The ``g2p_connect_demo`` module is primarily intended for developers and
implementers working with the OpenSPP system.

By using the provided interface, users can generate a specified number
of groups and individuals. The module takes care of creating realistic
relationships, assigning custom field values, and populating other
relevant data.

Disclaimer
----------

It is important to reiterate that this module is for **demonstration and
development purposes only**. The generated data, while designed to
appear realistic, should not be used in a production environment or for
any real-world social protection programs.

.. IMPORTANT::
   This is an alpha version, the data model and design can change at any time without warning.
   Only for development or testing purpose, do not use in production.
