# OpenSPP Entitlement Transactions

This document details the **OpenSPP Entitlement Transactions** module within the OpenSPP platform. This module is responsible for recording and managing transactions related to entitlement redemptions, providing a transparent and auditable history of benefit disbursement. It caters to both cash and in-kind entitlements, offering dedicated models and views for each type. 

## Purpose

The **OpenSPP Entitlement Transactions** module primarily focuses on:

* **Transaction Recording**: Captures detailed information for every entitlement redemption, including date, time, service point, user, and remaining entitlement value.
* **Audit Trail**: Provides a comprehensive history of entitlement transactions, enabling tracking of benefit disbursement, identifying potential issues, and supporting financial reconciliation.
* **Cash & In-Kind Support**: Offers dedicated models and views for cash-based and in-kind entitlement transactions, accommodating the specific data points required for each type.
* **Integration with Program & Registry Modules**: Seamlessly integrates with the [OpenSPP Programs](OpenSPP Programs)(#openspp-programs-module-documentation) module and relevant registry modules to link transactions back to specific entitlements, programs, and beneficiaries.

## Module Dependencies and Integration

1. **[spp_programs](spp_programs)**: 
    * Relies heavily on this module to access entitlement information. 
    * Links each transaction to its corresponding entitlement record, enabling tracking of redeemed amounts against total entitlement value.

2. **[g2p_registry_base](g2p_registry_base)**:
    * Utilizes the base registry module indirectly through the [OpenSPP Programs](OpenSPP Programs)(#openspp-programs-module-documentation) module.

    * Links transactions to the relevant registrant profiles, providing context and enabling analysis of benefit distribution at the beneficiary level.

3. **[g2p_programs](g2p_programs)**:
    * Integrates with program data to associate transactions with specific programs and cycles. 
    * Allows for program-level analysis of transaction trends, service point utilization, and overall program performance.

## Additional Functionality

        * **Service Point**:  Identifies the location where the transaction occurred.
        * **User**: Records the system user who processed the transaction.
        * **Amount Charged**: Captures the amount of the entitlement redeemed in the transaction. 
        * **Value Remaining**: Tracks the remaining balance of the entitlement after the transaction.

* **In-Kind Entitlement Transactions Model (spp.inkind.entitlement.transactions)**:
    * Manages transactions for in-kind entitlements, including details like:
        * **Product**:  Specifies the particular good or service redeemed. 
        * **Quantity**: Records the number of units of the product dispensed.
        * **Quantity Remaining**: Tracks the remaining quantity of the entitlement after the transaction.
