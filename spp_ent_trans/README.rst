OpenSPP Entitlement Transactions
================================

This document details the **OpenSPP Entitlement Transactions** module
within the OpenSPP platform. This module is responsible for recording
and managing transactions related to entitlement redemptions, providing
a transparent and auditable history of benefit disbursement. It caters
to both cash and in-kind entitlements, offering dedicated models and
views for each type.

Purpose
-------

The **OpenSPP Entitlement Transactions** module primarily focuses on:

-  **Transaction Recording**: Captures detailed information for every
   entitlement redemption, including date, time, service point, user,
   and remaining entitlement value.
-  **Audit Trail**: Provides a comprehensive history of entitlement
   transactions, enabling tracking of benefit disbursement, identifying
   potential issues, and supporting financial reconciliation.
-  **Cash & In-Kind Support**: Offers dedicated models and views for
   cash-based and in-kind entitlement transactions, accommodating the
   specific data points required for each type.
-  **Integration with Program & Registry Modules**: Seamlessly
   integrates with the [OpenSPP Programs](OpenSPP
   Programs)(#openspp-programs-module-documentation) module and relevant
   registry modules to link transactions back to specific entitlements,
   programs, and beneficiaries.

Module Dependencies and Integration
-----------------------------------

1. `spp_programs <spp_programs>`__:

   -  Relies heavily on this module to access entitlement information.
   -  Links each transaction to its corresponding entitlement record,
      enabling tracking of redeemed amounts against total entitlement
      value.

2. `g2p_registry_base <g2p_registry_base>`__:

   -  Utilizes the base registry module indirectly through the [OpenSPP
      Programs](OpenSPP
      Programs)(#openspp-programs-module-documentation) module.

   -  Links transactions to the relevant registrant profiles, providing
      context and enabling analysis of benefit distribution at the
      beneficiary level.

3. `g2p_programs <g2p_programs>`__:

   -  Integrates with program data to associate transactions with
      specific programs and cycles.
   -  Allows for program-level analysis of transaction trends, service
      point utilization, and overall program performance.

Additional Functionality
------------------------

-  **Cash Entitlement Transactions Model
   (spp.entitlement.transactions)**:

   -  Records transactions for cash-based entitlements, capturing
      details such as:

      -  **Transaction UUID**: Provides a unique identifier for each
         transaction.
      -  **Card Number**: Stores the beneficiary's card number used for
         redemption.
      -  **Service Point**: Identifies the location where the
         transaction occurred.
      -  **User**: Records the system user who processed the
         transaction.
      -  **Amount Charged**: Captures the amount of the entitlement
         redeemed in the transaction.
      -  **Value Remaining**: Tracks the remaining balance of the
         entitlement after the transaction.

-  **In-Kind Entitlement Transactions Model
   (spp.inkind.entitlement.transactions)**:

   -  Manages transactions for in-kind entitlements, including details
      like:

      -  **Product**: Specifies the particular good or service redeemed.
      -  **Quantity**: Records the number of units of the product
         dispensed.
      -  **Quantity Remaining**: Tracks the remaining quantity of the
         entitlement after the transaction.

-  **Dedicated Tree Views**:

   -  Offers separate tree views for both cash and in-kind transactions,
      providing clear and organized displays of transaction data.
   -  Views are filterable and searchable, enabling users to easily find
      and analyze specific transactions or trends.

-  **Menu Integration**:

   -  Integrates seamlessly into the OpenSPP menu structure, providing
      easy access to transaction data for authorized users.

Conclusion
----------

The **OpenSPP Entitlement Transactions** module is a crucial component
of OpenSPP, ensuring the accurate recording, tracking, and auditing of
benefit disbursements. Its integration with core program and registry
modules provides a holistic view of program operations, enabling better
monitoring, evaluation, and ultimately, improved delivery of social
protection benefits.
