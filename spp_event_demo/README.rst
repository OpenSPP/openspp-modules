OpenSPP Event Demo
==================

This module, `spp_event_demo <spp_event_demo>`__, provides demonstration
data and functionalities for the
**[spp_event_data](spp_event_demo](spp_event_data](spp_event_demo)**,
provides demonstration data and functionalities for the
**[spp_event_data)** module within the OpenSPP ecosystem. It showcases
how to extend and utilize the event tracking capabilities of OpenSPP for
specific use cases.

Relationship to spp_event_data
------------------------------

This module directly depends on and builds upon the functionalities of
the `spp_event_data <spp_event_data>`__ module. While
`spp_event_data <spp_event_data>`__ provides the core structure for
recording and managing events related to registrants,
**[spp_event_demo](spp_event_data](spp_event_demo](spp_event_data)**
module. While `spp_event_data <spp_event_data>`__ provides the core
structure for recording and managing events related to registrants,
**[spp_event_demo)** demonstrates practical applications of this system
through concrete examples.

Additional Functionality and Demonstrations
-------------------------------------------

1. **Predefined Event Types**:

   -  Introduces several predefined event types, including:

      -  **House Visit (spp.event.house.visit)**: Captures data
         collected during a household visit, including farm details,
         livestock numbers, and food security indicators.
      -  **Phone Survey (spp.event.phone.survey)**: Records information
         gathered through a phone-based survey, such as a summary and
         detailed description of the conversation.
      -  **School Enrollment Record
         (spp.event.schoolenrollment.record)**: Tracks school enrollment
         events, storing details about the school, enrollment type, and
         date.

2. **Data Models and Views**:

   -  Defines specific data models for each event type, each with
      relevant fields for capturing data.
   -  Provides user-friendly views (tree and form) for each event type,
      allowing for easy data entry, viewing, and management within the
      Odoo interface.

3. **Event Creation Wizards**:

   -  Includes dedicated wizards for creating new events:

      -  **Create Event: House Visit**: Guides users through the process
         of logging a house visit event, including capturing specific
         data points.
      -  **Create Event: Phone Survey**: Simplifies the recording of
         phone survey events.
      -  **Create Event: School Enrollment**: Facilitates the logging of
         school enrollment records.

4. **Integration with Registrant Profiles**:

   -  Extends the registrant profiles to display active events of each
      type, providing a quick overview of the latest events associated
      with a particular registrant.

Example Scenario
----------------

This module demonstrates how a program might use the
`spp_event_data <spp_event_data>`__ module. For example, a user could
record a series of house visits with a beneficiary. Each house visit
would be linked to the beneficiary's profile and the program could then
query for all beneficiaries who have had at least one house visit, or
all beneficiaries who have not had a house visit in the last 6 months.

Conclusion
----------

The `spp_event_demo <spp_event_demo>`__ module serves as a practical
guide and starting point for implementing custom event tracking within
OpenSPP. By providing concrete examples and pre-built components, it
empowers users to leverage the full potential of the
**[spp_event_data](spp_event_demo](spp_event_data](spp_event_demo)**
module serves as a practical guide and starting point for implementing
custom event tracking within OpenSPP. By providing concrete examples and
pre-built components, it empowers users to leverage the full potential
of the **[spp_event_data)** module and tailor it to their specific
program needs.
