OpenSPP Base API
================

Overview
--------

The `spp_base_api <spp_base_api>`__ module provides foundational API
functions and methods for interacting with the OpenSPP system. It acts
as a bridge between the core OpenSPP functionalities and external
systems, enabling data exchange via APIs or XML-RPC. This module does
not introduce any user-facing features but serves as a building block
for other modules that require API access to OpenSPP data.

Purpose
-------

The main purpose of this module is to:

-  Establish a standardized way to access and manipulate OpenSPP data
   externally.
-  Provide a consistent and reusable API framework for other OpenSPP
   modules.
-  Enable seamless integration with external applications and systems.

Functionality
-------------

The `spp_base_api <spp_base_api>`__ module introduces several key
functions and methods to the Odoo models, extending their capabilities
for API interaction:

-  **search_or_create**: Searches for a record based on given values. If
   no match is found, it creates a new record with the provided values.
-  **search_read_nested**: Performs a nested search across related
   models and returns a list of dictionaries representing the results.
   This allows retrieving data from multiple linked models in a single
   API call.
-  **create_or_update_by_external_id**: Creates or updates records based
   on an external ID. This is crucial for synchronizing data with
   external systems that rely on unique identifiers.

Integration with other modules
------------------------------

The `spp_base_api <spp_base_api>`__ module is designed to be a
dependency for other modules that need API access. For instance, a
hypothetical module
`spp_external_integration <spp_external_integration>`__ could depend on
`spp_base_api <spp_base_api>`__ module is designed to be a dependency
for other modules that need API access. For instance, a hypothetical
module ``spp_external_integration`` could depend on ``spp_base_api`` and
utilize its functions to:

1. Fetch data from OpenSPP through defined API endpoints.
2. Create or update records in OpenSPP based on data received from
   external systems.
3. Ensure data consistency between OpenSPP and other integrated
   applications.

By providing these base functionalities, the
`spp_base_api <spp_base_api>`__ module streamlines the development of
other OpenSPP modules that interact with external systems and APIs.
