OpenSPP API Records
===================

This document details the **OpenSPP API Records** module within the
OpenSPP platform. This module is responsible for defining and exposing
API endpoints that provide access to records and data related to
OpenSPP's core functionalities, including service points, programs,
entitlements, and registries.

Purpose
-------

The **OpenSPP API Records** module aims to:

-  **Expose Data via API:** Make OpenSPP's core data accessible through
   a well-defined RESTful API, enabling external systems and
   applications to interact with OpenSPP.
-  **Standardize Data Exchange:** Define consistent data formats and
   structures for API requests and responses, ensuring interoperability
   with various systems.
-  **Support Integration Efforts:** Facilitate the integration of
   OpenSPP with other systems used by governments, NGOs, and other
   stakeholders involved in social protection programs and farmer
   registries.

Module Dependencies and Integration
-----------------------------------

1. `spp_api <spp_api.md>`__:

   -  This module builds directly upon the `spp_api <spp_api>`__ module,
      inheriting its core API framework, security features (OAuth 2.0),
      and documentation generation capabilities.
   -  It leverages the API namespaces, paths, and authentication
      mechanisms provided by `spp_api <spp_api>`__ to define and expose
      its own set of API endpoints.

2. `spp_service_points <spp_service_points>`__:

   -  Integrates with the `spp_service_points <spp_service_points>`__
      module to expose data related to service points, their locations,
      operational status, and associated devices.
   -  API endpoints allow for retrieving service point details,
      searching for service points based on various criteria, and
      potentially updating service point information.

3. `spp_programs <spp_programs>`__:

   -  Connects with the `spp_programs <spp_programs>`__ module to make
      program data accessible through the API.
   -  Endpoints might include retrieving program details, listing
      program cycles, fetching eligibility criteria, and accessing
      information about enrolled beneficiaries.

4. **Product (product)**:

   -  Integrates with the **Product** module to provide API access to
      product information, particularly relevant for programs involving
      the distribution of in-kind benefits.
   -  API endpoints could enable retrieving product lists, details,
      stock levels, and other relevant data for managing in-kind
      entitlements.

5. `g2p_programs <g2p_programs>`__:

   -  Leverages the `g2p_programs <g2p_programs>`__ module to access and
      expose data related to program entitlements, payments, and
      beneficiary participation.
   -  API endpoints might facilitate the retrieval of entitlement
      details, payment histories, program participation status, and
      other program-related records.

6. **Contacts (contacts)**:

   -  Utilizes the **Contacts** module to access and potentially expose
      data related to individuals and organizations involved in OpenSPP,
      such as program managers, service point operators, and potentially
      registrant contact information (with appropriate privacy
      considerations).

7. `g2p_registry_base <g2p_registry_base>`__:

   -  Accesses data from the `g2p_registry_base <g2p_registry_base>`__
      module to potentially expose limited and anonymized registrant
      information through the API, strictly adhering to privacy and data
      protection regulations.
   -  API endpoints in this area would require robust authentication and
      authorization mechanisms to control access and prevent
      unauthorized data exposure.

Additional Functionality
------------------------

-  **API Endpoints for Record Access:**

   -  Defines and implements specific API endpoints to retrieve, search,
      and potentially modify data related to OpenSPP's core entities
      (service points, programs, products, entitlements, etc.).
   -  Implements data validation, error handling, and appropriate
      response codes (e.g., 200 OK, 404 Not Found) to ensure API
      reliability and usability.

-  **Data Serialization and Transformation:**

   -  Handles the conversion of OpenSPP's internal data structures and
      formats into standardized representations suitable for API
      exchange (e.g., JSON or XML).
   -  Implements any necessary data transformations or filtering to
      present information in a way that is meaningful and consumable by
      external systems.

-  **API Versioning and Documentation:**

   -  Adheres to best practices for API versioning, allowing for
      backward compatibility and controlled evolution of the API over
      time.
   -  Leverages the documentation generation capabilities of
      `spp_api <spp_api>`__ to provide comprehensive and up-to-date
      documentation for all exposed endpoints, including
      request/response formats, authentication requirements, and example
      usage.

Conclusion
----------

The **OpenSPP API Records** module plays a vital role in extending
OpenSPP's reach and interoperability. By exposing core data through a
well-defined and secure API, it enables seamless integration with other
systems, facilitating data exchange, automating processes, and
empowering external stakeholders to interact with OpenSPP in a
standardized and controlled manner.
