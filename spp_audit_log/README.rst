OpenSPP Audit Log
=================

This module provides audit logging functionality for OpenSPP, enabling
the tracking of changes made to specific data within the system. It
helps maintain data integrity, accountability, and provides a historical
record of modifications.

Purpose
-------

The **SPP Audit Log** module is designed to:

-  **Record Data Changes:** Automatically log changes made to specified
   fields within selected models.
-  **Track User Actions:** Identify the user responsible for each data
   modification.
-  **Provide an Audit Trail:** Maintain a chronological log of changes,
   including old and new values, for review and analysis.

Module Dependencies and Integration
-----------------------------------

1. **Base (base)**: The module relies on Odoo's core features for
   models, views, security groups, and user management.

2. **Mail (mail):** Leverages the messaging functionality for potential
   future enhancements related to audit log notifications.

3. **G2P Registry: Membership
   (**\ `g2p_registry_membership <g2p_registry_membership>`__\ **):**
   This dependency appears to be related to a specific use case and
   might not be a core dependency for the audit log functionality. It
   could indicate that the audit log is being used to track changes
   within the group membership model.

Additional Functionality
------------------------

The module introduces the following key elements:

-  **Audit Rule Model (**\ `spp.audit.rule <spp.audit.rule>`__\ **):**

   -  Allows administrators to define rules specifying which models and
      fields should have their changes logged.
   -  Provides options to log the creation, update, or deletion of
      records.
   -  Includes a feature to automatically add a "View Logs" button to
      the related model's form view for easy access to audit logs.

-  **Audit Log Model (**\ `spp.audit.log <spp.audit.log>`__\ **):**

   -  Stores the audit log entries, capturing details like timestamp,
      user, model, record ID, type of operation (create/write/unlink),
      and the changes made (old and new values).
   -  Provides a computed field to display the changed data in a
      user-friendly HTML format within the audit log form view.

-  **Audit Decorator:**

   -  Utilizes a decorator function to automatically intercept and log
      changes made to models and fields defined by the audit rules. This
      simplifies the implementation and ensures that auditing is applied
      consistently.

-  **Security Groups:**

   -  Introduces a new security group, "Manager," to manage access to
      audit log rules and logs, restricting sensitive information from
      unauthorized users.

-  **User Interface:**

   -  Adds menu items for managing audit rules and viewing audit logs,
      providing centralized access points within the OpenSPP interface.

Conclusion
----------

The **SPP Audit Log** module enhances the accountability and
transparency of the OpenSPP platform. By meticulously tracking data
changes and user actions, it provides administrators with a valuable
tool for auditing, troubleshooting, and maintaining data integrity. The
module's flexible rule system and tight integration with core Odoo
features make it adaptable to a variety of data tracking requirements
within the OpenSPP ecosystem.
