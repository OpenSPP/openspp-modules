OpenSPP Audit Config
====================

This document outlines the **OpenSPP Audit Config** module within the
OpenSPP platform. This module is responsible for configuring and
managing audit rules used to track and log changes made to critical data
within the system.

Purpose
-------

The primary purpose of the **OpenSPP Audit Config** module is to:

-  **Define Audit Rules:** Establish specific rules that determine which
   data models, fields, and actions (create, update, delete) should be
   monitored and logged.
-  **Enhance Data Security:** Provide an auditable trail of changes made
   to sensitive information, ensuring accountability and enabling
   investigations into unauthorized modifications.
-  **Improve Data Integrity:** By logging changes, the module helps
   identify potential data inconsistencies or errors introduced during
   data entry or updates.

Module Integration and Dependencies
-----------------------------------

The **OpenSPP Audit Config** module works in conjunction with other
modules to provide comprehensive audit logging:

-  `SPP Audit Log <spp_audit_log>`__: This module is responsible for
   storing the actual audit logs generated based on the configured
   rules. The Audit Config module defines **what** to log, and the Audit
   Log module handles **how** it is logged and stored.
-  `SPP Audit Post <spp_audit_post>`__: The Audit Post module provides
   the mechanisms for reviewing and managing the generated audit logs.
   It offers interfaces to view, filter, and analyze the log data.

**Integration with Other Modules:**

The **OpenSPP Audit Config** module's functionality is designed to be
applied across various OpenSPP modules. It can define audit rules for
any module that requires change tracking, such as:

-  `SPP Service Points <spp_service_points>`__: Track changes to service
   point information, including location, contact details, and
   operational status.
-  `G2P Registry: Membership <g2p_registry_membership>`__: Monitor
   modifications to individual memberships within groups, ensuring
   accurate representation of group composition.
-  `OpenSPP Programs <spp_programs>`__: Log any updates to program
   configurations, eligibility criteria, or benefit distribution
   details.

Additional Functionality
------------------------

1. **Audit Rule Definition:**

   -  Provides a user-friendly interface to define audit rules.
   -  **Key configuration options include:**

      -  **Model:** Specify the data model to be audited (e.g.,
         ``spp.service.point``, ``g2p.group.membership``).
      -  **Fields:** Select the specific fields within the model that
         require logging (e.g., ``name``, ``status``, ``start_date``).
      -  **Actions:** Choose which actions should trigger a log entry:

         -  **Create:** Log the creation of new records.
         -  **Write:** Log any modifications made to existing records.
         -  **Unlink:** Log the deletion of records.

   -  **Advanced Rule Configuration:** The module supports defining
      hierarchical audit rules:

      -  **Parent-Child Relationships:** Link audit rules to create a
         parent-child hierarchy. This allows for more granular logging,
         capturing changes to related records. For example, if a service
         point is linked to a program, any changes to the service point
         can trigger logs for both the service point itself and the
         associated program.
      -  **Connecting Fields:** When defining hierarchical rules, the
         module lets you specify the field that connects the parent and
         child records.

2. **Predefined Audit Rules:**

   -  The module includes a set of predefined audit rules for common
      data models and fields within the OpenSPP system. These rules
      provide a starting point for implementing audit logging and can be
      customized further based on specific needs.

3. **Data/audit_rule_data.xml:**

   -  This file contains predefined audit rules that are loaded during
      the module installation. This ensures essential auditing is in
      place from the start.

Conclusion
----------

The **OpenSPP Audit Config** module plays a crucial role in enhancing
data security and integrity within the OpenSPP platform. By enabling the
configuration of flexible and comprehensive audit rules, the module
provides administrators with the tools to track changes, ensure
accountability, and maintain the reliability of critical data across
various OpenSPP modules.
