# OpenSPP Registrant Tags

This document outlines the functionality of the **OpenSPP Registrant Tags** module within the OpenSPP ecosystem. This module extends the tagging capabilities of the [g2p_registry_base](g2p_registry_base) module, enabling more organized and efficient management of registrant data.

## Purpose

The **OpenSPP Registrant Tags** module aims to:

* Provide a user-friendly interface for creating and managing tags specifically for registrants.
* Enhance the organization and categorization of registrants within the OpenSPP system.
* Facilitate efficient searching and filtering of registrants based on assigned tags.

## Module Dependencies and Integration

1. **[g2p_registry_base](g2p_registry_base)**: This module builds upon the foundational registry functionalities provided by the **G2P Registry: Base** module. It leverages the existing tagging infrastructure within that module to ensure seamless integration.

## Functionality

The **OpenSPP Registrant Tags** module primarily focuses on providing a dedicated interface for managing registrant tags. This includes:

* **Creating New Tags**: Users can easily define and create new tags relevant to categorizing registrants based on specific criteria (e.g., program eligibility, demographic information, geographic location).
* **Assigning Tags to Registrants**:  When adding or editing registrant information, users can select and assign relevant tags from the available list. 
* **Filtering and Searching by Tags**:  The module enables users to quickly search for registrants associated with specific tags.  This streamlines data management and analysis within the registry.

## Conclusion

The **OpenSPP Registrant Tags** module, while seemingly simple, provides valuable functionality for organizing and managing large datasets of registrants within OpenSPP. By offering a focused approach to registrant tagging, it enhances the usability and efficiency of the overall registry system.
