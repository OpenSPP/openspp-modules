OpenSPP Change Request: Add Farmer
==================================

Overview
--------

The `spp_change_request_add_farmer <spp_change_request_add_farmer>`__
module extends the OpenSPP Change Request system to specifically handle
requests for adding new farmers to existing groups within the registry.
It leverages the framework provided by the
`spp_change_request <spp_change_request>`__ module and integrates with
other registry modules to streamline the process of adding farmers while
maintaining data integrity and consistency.

Purpose
-------

-  **Specialized Change Request Type**: Introduce a dedicated change
   request type for adding farmers, distinct from other types of
   registrant modifications.
-  **Streamlined Data Collection**: Provide a tailored form for
   capturing essential information about the new farmer, including
   personal details, farmer-specific attributes, and desired group
   membership details.
-  **Group Membership Management**: Integrate with the
   `g2p_registry_membership <g2p_registry_membership>`__ module to
   seamlessly add the new farmer to the specified group upon approval.
-  **Enhanced Validation**: Implement specific validation rules relevant
   to adding farmers, ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the
   submitted information.

Module Integration
------------------

Dependencies
------------

The module relies heavily on the following modules:

-  `spp_change_request <spp_change_request>`__: Inherits the core change
   request functionality, including the request workflow, validation
   processes, approval mechanisms, and integration with the Document
   Management System (`spp_dms <spp_dms>`__).
-  `spp_farmer_registry_base <spp_farmer_registry_base>`__: Leverages
   the farmer-specific data models and attributes to capture and store
   information about the new farmer.
-  `g2p_registry_membership <g2p_registry_membership>`__: Integrates
   with the membership management system to create the appropriate group
   membership record for the new farmer upon change request approval.
-  `phone_validation <phone_validation>`__: Utilizes the phone
   validation module to ensure phone number entries for the new farmer
   adhere to correct formatting.
-  `g2p_registry_group <g2p_registry_group>`__: Accesses group
   information and functionality to display details about the target
   group for the new farmer.
-  `g2p_registry_individual <g2p_registry_individual>`__: Leverages
   individual registrant management features, inheriting from the
   individual registrant model.
-  `spp_service_points <spp_service_points>`__: Integrates with service
   points, allowing change requests to be initiated and managed through
   designated service points.

Additional Functionality
------------------------

-  **Custom Change Request Model**: Introduces the
   ``spp.change.request.add.farmer`` model, inheriting from the base
   ``spp.change.request`` model and adding fields specific to adding
   farmers, such as farmer-specific details and group membership
   information.
-  **Tailored Forms**: Provides specialized views for creating,
   displaying, and validating ``Add Farmer`` change requests, including
   a dedicated form (``view_change_request_add_farmer_form``) with
   relevant fields and a validation-focused form
   (``view_change_request_add_farmer_validation_form``).
-  **Automated Individual and Membership Creation**: Upon validation and
   approval of the change request, the module automatically creates:

   -  A new individual registrant record (``res.partner``) for the
      farmer, populating it with the submitted data.
   -  A corresponding group membership record
      (``g2p.group.membership``), linking the newly created farmer to
      the designated group.

-  **Enhanced User Interface**: Adds specific menu items and actions to
   the OpenSPP interface, allowing users to efficiently manage
   ``Add Farmer`` requests.

Conclusion
----------

The `spp_change_request_add_farmer <spp_change_request_add_farmer>`__
module provides a robust and specialized workflow for adding new farmers
to existing groups within the OpenSPP registry. By seamlessly
integrating with core change management and registry modules, it ensures
data accuracy, consistency, and a streamlined user experience for
managing farmer additions.
