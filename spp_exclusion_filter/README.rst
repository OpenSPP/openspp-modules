OpenSPP Exclusion Filter
========================

This document outlines the functionality of the **OpenSPP Exclusion
Filter** module. This module enhances the program creation process
within OpenSPP by introducing exclusion filters during the program
wizard.

Purpose
-------

The **OpenSPP Exclusion Filter** module aims to:

-  **Streamline Program Targeting**: Simplify the process of excluding
   specific registrant groups during program creation, ensuring that
   benefits are directed to the intended population.
-  **Improve Efficiency**: Reduce manual effort required to identify and
   exclude ineligible registrants from new programs.
-  **Enhance Program Accuracy**: Minimize the risk of including
   ineligible beneficiaries by applying pre-defined exclusion criteria.

Module Dependencies and Integration
-----------------------------------

1. `spp_programs <spp_programs>`__:

   -  Integrates with the OpenSPP program creation wizard, adding a
      dedicated step for configuring exclusion filters.
   -  Leverages program data, such as target criteria and program
      objectives, to guide the selection of relevant exclusion filters.

2. `g2p_registry_base <g2p_registry_base>`__:

   -  Utilizes registrant data, including demographics, tags, and
      relationships, to apply exclusion filters.
   -  Accesses the registry to identify and flag registrants who meet
      the specified exclusion criteria.

3. `g2p_programs <g2p_programs>`__:

   -  Extends the functionality of OpenG2P's program creation process.
   -  Ensures compatibility with existing program management features
      and workflows.

Additional Functionality
------------------------

-  **Program Wizard Integration**:

   -  Adds a dedicated step to the program creation wizard, allowing
      program managers to select and configure exclusion filters.
   -  Provides a user-friendly interface for defining exclusion criteria
      and previewing the potential impact on the target population.

-  **Eligibility Manager Integration (Potentially)**:

   -  May integrate with existing eligibility managers to leverage
      pre-defined eligibility rules as exclusion criteria.
   -  Could offer the flexibility to create exclusion filters based on
      combinations of eligibility criteria.

-  **Automated Exclusion**:

   -  Upon program creation, the module automatically applies the
      selected exclusion filters to the registry.
   -  Flags registrants who meet the exclusion criteria, preventing them
      from being considered for enrollment in the program.

Conclusion
----------

The **OpenSPP Exclusion Filter** module streamlines program targeting by
introducing a structured approach to excluding ineligible registrants
during program creation. Its integration with the OpenSPP program
wizard, reliance on registry data, and potential integration with
eligibility managers enhance the efficiency and accuracy of program
implementation.
