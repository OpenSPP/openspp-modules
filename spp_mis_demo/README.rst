OpenSPP Demo
============

The ``spp_demo`` module serves as a demonstration and testing ground for
the OpenSPP system, showcasing its capabilities with pre-populated data.
It builds upon core OpenSPP modules to create a realistic simulation of
social protection programs and registries in action.

Purpose
-------

-  **Illustrate OpenSPP Functionality:** The module provides tangible
   examples of how various OpenSPP components work together,
   demonstrating data flow and interactions between modules.
-  **Facilitate User Exploration:** Pre-populated data allows users to
   explore the system's interface, features, and data structures without
   manually creating extensive test data.
-  **Accelerate Training:** The demo module serves as a valuable tool
   for training users on OpenSPP, providing a controlled environment to
   practice workflows and tasks.

Dependencies and Integration
----------------------------

The ``spp_demo`` module relies heavily on the following OpenSPP modules:

-  `theme_openspp_muk <theme_openspp_muk>`__ Applies a specific visual
   theme to the OpenSPP user interface for demonstration purposes.
-  `g2p_registry_membership <g2p_registry_membership>`__ (G2P Registry:
   Membership): Utilizes this module to establish and demonstrate
   relationships between individual and group registrants.
-  `spp_custom_field <spp_custom_field>`__ (OpenSPP Custom Field):
   Leverages this module to create and showcase custom fields added to
   registrant profiles, illustrating the flexibility of OpenSPP in
   capturing program-specific data.
-  `queue_job <queue_job>`__ (Queue Job): Employs the Queue Job module
   to handle background tasks, demonstrating asynchronous processing for
   operations like data generation and potentially eligibility checks.
-  `g2p_registry_individual <g2p_registry_individual>`__ (G2P Registry:
   Individual): Relies on this module to populate the system with sample
   individual registrant data.
-  `spp_area <spp_area>`__ (OpenSPP Area): Integrates with this module
   to demonstrate the association of registrants and programs with
   geographical areas.
-  `spp_custom_field_recompute_daily <spp_custom_field_recompute_daily>`__
   (OpenSPP Custom Field: Recompute Daily): May utilize this module to
   showcase the automatic daily recomputation of specific custom fields,
   highlighting OpenSPP's ability to maintain up-to-date data.
-  `g2p_registry_base <g2p_registry_base>`__ (G2P Registry: Base):
   Builds upon the base registry module for core registrant management
   functionalities.
-  `g2p_registry_group <g2p_registry_group>`__ (G2P Registry: Groups):
   Leverages this module to create and manage sample groups of
   registrants.
-  `spp_base_demo <spp_base_demo>`__: This module provides basic
   demonstration data for the OpenSPP system, including users, gender
   options and products.
-  `g2p_programs <g2p_programs>`__ (G2P Programs): Utilizes this module
   extensively to define and demonstrate social protection programs,
   eligibility criteria, program cycles, and potentially beneficiary
   enrollment and entitlement processes.

Additional Functionality
------------------------

-  **Data Generation Utilities:** The module includes Python scripts and
   functions within the ``models/`` directory to generate a variety of
   sample data, such as:

   -  **Randomized Registrant Data:** Creates individual and group
      registrants with realistic names, demographics, contact
      information, and relationships, often leveraging external
      libraries like ``faker`` for randomized data generation.
   -  **Program Data:** Generates demo programs with varying target
      types (individual, group), eligibility rules, and program cycles.
      This may also include the creation of sample entitlements and
      payment records to simulate program activity.
   -  **Geographical Area Data:** Populates the system with sample area
      hierarchies, linking registrants and programs to specific
      locations to demonstrate the geographical aspects of OpenSPP.

-  **User Interface Integration:** The module includes XML files within
   the ``views/`` directory that extend or modify the OpenSPP user
   interface, such as:

   -  **Data Generation Actions:** Adds buttons or menu items within
      relevant sections of the interface to trigger data generation
      scripts. This provides an easy way for users to populate the demo
      environment with sample data.
   -  **Custom Views:** May include custom views or modifications to
      existing views to highlight specific aspects of the demo data or
      showcase particular functionalities.

Conclusion
----------

The ``spp_demo`` module is an essential component of the OpenSPP
ecosystem for demonstration, testing, and training purposes. It provides
a rich and interactive environment for users to explore the system's
capabilities and understand how different modules work together to
manage social protection programs and registries.
