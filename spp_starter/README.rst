OpenSPP Starter Module
======================

This module serves as the starting point for configuring and launching a
new OpenSPP instance. It doesn't introduce any specific business logic
or data models related to social protection programs or farmer
registries. Instead, it focuses on providing a basic setup and
customization options for the OpenSPP platform.

Functionality
-------------

-  **Configuration:** The module allows administrators to enable or
   disable the display of a custom menu entry that directs users to the
   OpenSPP modules and functionalities.
-  **User Interface:** It can replace the standard Odoo "Management"
   menu with a dedicated OpenSPP menu, guiding users towards the
   relevant features for managing social protection programs and farmer
   registries.

Dependencies
------------

-  **base:** This module depends on the Odoo base module, inheriting its
   functionality for menus and user interface elements.

Integration
-----------

The `spp_starter <spp_starter>`__ module doesn't directly integrate with
other specific modules related to social protection or farmer
registries. However, it acts as a foundation upon which other modules
can build and extend the platform's capabilities. By modifying the menu
structure and providing configuration options, it prepares the system
for the installation and utilization of more specialized modules.

Key Components
--------------

-  **ir.config_parameter:** Utilizes configuration parameters to control
   the visibility of the OpenSPP menu entry, allowing administrators to
   customize the user experience based on the specific implementation
   needs.
-  **ir.ui.menu:** Inherits from the ``ir.ui.menu`` model to override
   the default menu visibility, replacing the standard "Management" menu
   with an OpenSPP-specific menu when configured.

Usage
-----

Once the module is installed, administrators can configure the
visibility of the OpenSPP menu entry by accessing the system parameters.
Depending on the chosen configuration, users will see either the
standard Odoo "Management" menu or a custom OpenSPP menu, guiding them
to the relevant sections for managing social protection programs and
farmer registries.
