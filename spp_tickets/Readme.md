# SPP Ticket Module

## Overview

The SPP Ticket Module is designed to enhance the management of inquiries, requests, and reports within social
protection programs. By integrating directly into Odoo's ecosystem, this module offers a streamlined approach
to handling tickets related to beneficiaries, service providers, and administrative processes. The module
ensures efficient tracking, assignment, and resolution of tickets, fostering improved communication and
service delivery.

## Features

### Ticket Management

- **Create, Track, and Update Tickets:** Users can create tickets for a variety of needs, including inquiries,
  requests, and complaints. Each ticket goes through a lifecycle from creation to closure, with the ability to
  track its progress and update its details as needed.
- **Ticket Assignment:** Tickets can be manually assigned to specific support staff or automatically
  distributed based on predefined rules, ensuring that the right personnel are working on resolving the
  issues.
- **Prioritization and Types:** Tickets can be categorized by type (e.g., inquiry, request, complaint) and
  prioritized (e.g., low, medium, high, urgent) to ensure that critical issues are addressed promptly.
- **Status Tracking:** The module allows for detailed status updates (e.g., new, in progress, resolved,
  closed) to keep all stakeholders informed about the progress of ticket resolution.

### Integration with Res.Partner

- **Partner Association:** Every ticket is linked to a `res.partner` record, enabling a clear connection
  between tickets and the relevant beneficiaries, service providers, or other entities. This integration
  facilitates better management of relationships and communication.

### User Roles and Permissions

- **Configurable Access Control:** The module supports role-based access control, ensuring that users only
  have access to the functions and data relevant to their roles within the organization. Specific permissions
  can be configured for creating, viewing, editing, and deleting tickets.

### Reporting and Analytics

- **Insightful Reporting:** Users can generate reports on various metrics such as ticket volume, resolution
  time, and user satisfaction. These insights can help in identifying areas for improvement and in making
  data-driven decisions.

### Notifications and Communications

- **Automated Notifications:** The module supports sending automated notifications to users and support staff
  based on ticket activity. Notifications can be customized to ensure relevant stakeholders are kept up to
  date.
