OpenSPP Programs: Service Points Integration
============================================

This document outlines the **OpenSPP Programs (Service Points
Integration)** module, which extends the OpenSPP platform to integrate
the management of service points within social protection programs. This
module enables programs to link entitlements and beneficiaries with
designated service points, streamlining the delivery of benefits and
improving program efficiency.

Purpose
-------

The `spp_programs_sp <spp_programs_sp>`__ module bridges the
functionality of the [OpenSPP Programs](OpenSPP Programs) module and the
[OpenSPP Service Points](OpenSPP Service Points) module, providing a
seamless way to incorporate service point information into program
operations. This integration is particularly beneficial for programs
involving in-kind distributions or requiring beneficiaries to interact
with designated service providers.

Role and Functionality
----------------------

Building upon its dependencies, this module focuses on enhancing program
management with service point integration:

-  `OpenSPP Service Points <spp_service_points>`__: This module provides
   the framework for managing service point data, including location,
   contact information, and operational status. The
   `spp_programs_sp <spp_programs_sp>`__ module leverages this data to
   associate service points with programs and entitlements.
-  `OpenSPP Programs <spp_programs>`__: This module defines the core
   structure and management of social protection programs, including
   program cycles, eligibility criteria, and entitlement management. The
   `spp_programs_sp <spp_programs_sp>`__ module extends this
   functionality to incorporate service point information into the
   entitlement generation and distribution process.
-  `OpenSPP Program Entitlement (Cash) <spp_entitlement_cash>`__: This
   module specializes in managing cash-based entitlements. The
   `spp_programs_sp <spp_programs_sp>`__ module extends this to
   optionally link cash entitlements with service points, potentially
   for cash pickup or other service-related interactions.
-  `OpenSPP In-Kind Entitlement <spp_entitlement_in_kind>`__: This
   module manages the distribution of in-kind benefits. The
   `spp_programs_sp <spp_programs_sp>`__ module enhances this by
   associating in-kind entitlements with specific service points for
   beneficiary redemption.
-  `G2P Programs <g2p_programs>`__: This module provides the
   foundational program management features upon which [OpenSPP
   Programs](OpenSPP Programs) builds. The
   `spp_programs_sp <spp_programs_sp>`__ module inherits this
   foundation, extending it with service point integration.

Key Features
------------

1. **Program Configuration:**

   -  Extends the ``g2p.program`` model from [G2P Programs](G2P
      Programs) to include a configuration option
      (``store_sp_in_entitlements``) that determines whether service
      points should be stored with entitlements.
   -  This allows program administrators to enable or disable service
      point integration based on the specific needs of the program.

2. **Entitlement Manager Enhancement:**

   -  Modifies the entitlement manager models
      (``g2p.program.entitlement.manager.default``,
      ``g2p.program.entitlement.manager.cash``,
      ``g2p.program.entitlement.manager.inkind``) to include service
      point information when generating entitlements.
   -  If enabled in the program configuration, the entitlement manager
      will automatically associate the beneficiary's designated service
      points with their entitlement records.

3. **Entitlement Model Extension:**

   -  Extends the ``g2p.entitlement`` and ``g2p.entitlement.inkind``
      models from [G2P Programs](G2P Programs) and [OpenSPP In-Kind
      Entitlement](OpenSPP In-Kind Entitlement) respectively, adding a
      field (``service_point_ids``) to store the service points linked
      to the entitlement.

4. **User Interface Integration:**

   -  Modifies the program configuration view to include the
      ``store_sp_in_entitlements`` option.
   -  Extends the entitlement views to display the associated service
      points, providing visibility into the designated redemption
      locations.

Benefits
--------

-  **Targeted Benefit Delivery:** Enables programs to direct
   beneficiaries to specific service points for receiving benefits,
   improving the efficiency of distribution and reducing confusion.
-  **Enhanced Service Provision:** Facilitates the coordination of
   services by linking entitlements with service providers, allowing for
   better tracking and management of service delivery.
-  **Improved Data Management:** Integrates service point information
   directly into the entitlement management process, ensuring data
   consistency and facilitating more comprehensive reporting and
   analysis.
-  **Streamlined Operations:** Automates the association of service
   points with entitlements, reducing manual data entry and minimizing
   errors.

Conclusion
----------

The [OpenSPP Programs (Service Points Integration)](OpenSPP Programs
(Service Points Integration)) module enhances the OpenSPP platform by
seamlessly integrating service point management with the core program
functionalities. This integration is particularly valuable for programs
involving in-kind distributions, service provision, or requiring
designated points of interaction between beneficiaries and program
implementers. By connecting beneficiaries, entitlements, and service
providers, this module contributes to a more efficient, transparent, and
beneficiary-centric approach to social protection program delivery.
